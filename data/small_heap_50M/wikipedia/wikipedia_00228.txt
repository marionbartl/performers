The Théâtre de l'Étoile was a theatre located at 136 Avenue des Champs-Élysées in the 8th arrondissement of Paris . It was built in 1923 and operated as a theatre until 1926 . It is not to be confused with a completely unrelated theatre , also called Théâtre de l'Étoile , which operated from 1928 to 1964 on the Avenue Wagram .
History
The theatre was built on the initiative of the playwright , director , and theatre manager who at the time was also the manager of the Théâtre Édouard VII . The new theatre , decorated in a colour scheme of red and gold , was situated on the first floor of a building on the corner of Avenue des Champs-Élysées and Rue Balzac . The building 's penthouse was occupied by the flamboyant art collector and interior designer Carlos de Beistegui .
Under Franck 's direction the theatre staged Sacha Guitry 's comedy L'Accroche-cœur in 1923 and Revue de Printemps in 1924 , both starring Guitry and his then-wife Yvonne Printemps . Both were very successful , but subsequent productions of the operettas Amants légitimes and Pouche ( with a libretto by Franck ) were commercial failures .
In 1925 Franck sold the Étoile to Camille Choisy , the manager of the Théâtre du Grand-Guignol , and Jacques Jouvin , one of the directors there . At the Étoile , they premiered René Mercier 's operetta Le Pêché capiteux starring Arletty in September 1925 and in November staged Josephine Baker 's show La Revue Nègre after its initial run at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées .
The theatre closed definitively in early 1926 after which it became a dance and cabaret hall operating under a variety of names in the ensuing years : `` L'Embassy '' , `` Le panache '' , and `` La joie dans la cave '' . It was eventually demolished and replaced by offices and shops .

Plot
On the way to the command center where they will oversee the CIA mission , Quinn ( Rupert Friend ) tells Carrie ( Claire Danes ) that he looked at her medical records while she was wounded and knows she 's pregnant . He suggests that for the rest of the mission , Carrie ought to sit out . Carrie angrily responds by denying that the baby is Brody 's .
The special ops soldiers have brought Brody ( Damian Lewis ) to the Kurdish Regional Government region of Iraq , near the Iran-Iraq border , and they are waiting for nightfall . Kurdish police officers approach them and ask the ops team questions , and not believing their cover story , the officers draw their firearms . The special ops leader , Azizi ( Donnie Keshawarz ) , says the codeword `` good night '' , which signals the soldiers to kill the policemen . Seeing the violence , Brody becomes scared and flees , but Azizi makes him calm down .
The operation is being watched over at the White House by Dar Adal and Mike Higgins , the White House Chief of Staff . Higgins is upset by the police officers being murdered and orders that two people , Senator Lockhart and JSOC Commander Bill Pfister ( Peter Bradbury ) , be sent to the operations room as advisers .
Azizi drives Brody to the border while the other special ops soldiers stay back . Before they get there , the truck runs over a land mine , likely one left over from the Iran-Iraq war , and it is blown in half . Both men are shaken up and Azizi loses his left leg . The special ops soldiers rush to help them . The explosion attracts the Kurdish Peshmerga , who start firing at the group .
Saul ( Mandy Patinkin ) , believing that the intelligence mission has failed and this is now a military operation , yields command to Pfister and leaves the room . Pfister orders the team to fall back and abort , and soldiers start falling back , but Brody refuses , planning instead to dash for the border while the machine gun fire continues around him . Carrie gets on the line and asks him to give up , but he is insistent . One of the soldiers , Turani ( Jared Ward ) , decides to hang back for a minute and help Brody by supplying covering fire . Just as Brody is about to run for it , the Iranian army appears and captures both of them . Brody announces that he is the perpetrator of the CIA bombing and is requesting asylum . The two of them are put in a holding cell .
Carrie tells Fara ( Nazanin Boniadi ) that they have a field agent in Iran who has lost his support system and will need to be extracted at a precise time . She asks Fara whether her uncle in Iran would be able to supply a safehouse . Fara is reluctant to put her family at risk .
Majid Javadi ( Shaun Toub ) , now being blackmailed by the CIA , enters the cell and is ready to take Brody to Tehran . Brody asks what will happen to Turani , at which point Javadi shoots Turani in the head .

Plot
Billu ( Jayam Ravi ) is the son of Mudaliar ( Vijayakumar ) . Mudaliar is much loved and respected by the people of his locality , and Billu is almost like a foster son to every person in the locality .
Billu takes an instant liking for Susi ( Bhavana ) the moment he sets his eyes on her at the railway station . Susi , who has arrived from Bangalore to Chennai , is all set to stay at Settu 's ( Cochin Haneefa ) place . Settu , who has worked for Susi 's father Chidambaram ( Lal ) , a dreaded thug , earlier , has changed ways , but retains his respect towards him nevertheless . Susi , who has been craving for love and concern since young , gets impressed with the bonding that the Royapuram residents share . When a Godman predicts Susi is the one for Billu , and she is taken aback . She dreads her father to a great extent and fears that things will go topsy-turvy if their relationship blossoms into love . But soon , she realizes she can not camouflage her feelings towards Billu and enjoys being in the company of Billu and his friends , when the unexpected occurs .
Susi acts peculiar when a long-lost friend meets her at a restaurant . She denies knowing her , despite her friend Revathi 's ( Meenal ) attempts to talk to her . Feeling insulted , Revathi walks away , much to the dismay and confusion of Billu and his friends . Susi , who gets emotionally high-strung , leaves the restaurant in a jiffy too . Susi , at this juncture , comes out with the truth to Billu . Affected with PTSD after an accident , Susi has forgotten events that happened in a span of three years . Billu , who takes her to the doctor Devasaghayam ( Raghuvaran ) , learns that this condition can be cured , but when she does get cured , Susi will not be in a position to remember whatever happened and whoever she met at Chennai - Billu included .
This disheartens Susi to a major extent , and she persuades Billu to promise her that he would never leave her , even if she were to forget him due to her condition . Billu promises her that he would never leave her , come whatever may . Billu 's conversation with Chidambaram infuriates the latter , and he immediately arrives in Chennai with his goons . When he is all set to leave for Bangalore with his daughter , the residents rise to the occasion and flock against Chidambaram . Deciding to play it safe , Chidambaram agrees to the engagement between Billu and Susi , and cunningly , thrashes Billu after making him arrive at a place far from his locality , at the outskirts . The helpless Susi travels along with her father , escorted by his men , to Bangalore .
When Billu meets Susi at her residence , he gets nothing less than shocked as she has been cured , and she fails to recognize him . But Billu , who had given the word to his beloved that he would never leave her , is not the one to relent . How he tries relentlessly to convince her and what happens with Susi forms the rest of the story .

Commander , Naval Air Force Atlantic ( a. k. a. COMNAVAIRLANT , AIRLANT , and CNAL ) is the aviation Type Commander ( TYCOM ) for the United States Naval aviation units operating primarily in the Atlantic under United States Fleet Forces Command . Type Commanders are in administrative control ( ADCON ) , and in some cases operational control ( OPCON ) of certain types of assets ( ships , submarines , aircraft , and fleet marines ) assigned to the Pacific and Atlantic Fleets . AIRLANT is responsible for the material readiness , administration , training , and inspection of units/squadrons under their command , and for providing operationally ready air squadrons and aircraft carriers to the fleet .
COMNAVAIRLANT is headquartered at Naval Support Activity , Hampton Roads . The staff is made up of approximately 650 officers , enlisted , civilian and contractor personnel .
Mission
`` Support COMLANTFLT and other commanders by providing combat ready/sustainable naval air forces , trained and equipped in an environment which emphasizes safety , interoperability and efficient resource management . ''
History
Naval Air Force , US Atlantic Fleet was established on 1 January 1943 , at NAS Norfolk , Virginia . The command was initially called Air Force , Atlantic Fleet and replaced three older organizations : Commander Carriers , Atlantic Fleet ; Carrier Replacement Squadron , Atlantic Fleet ; and Fleet Air Wings , Atlantic .
AIRLANT 's mission was to oversee logistics , maintenance and training of east coast aviation units , and to direct all World War II Atlantic operations not assigned to specific task forces . The combat mission consisted primarily of combating German U-boats , which were wreaking havoc on U.S. shipping support for the war effort in Europe .
AIRLANT also contributed heavily to war in the Pacific by training Pacific Fleet units and deploying east coast units to the Pacific . In 1944 AIRLANT deployed 16 carriers , 20 carrier air groups , 67 carrier-based squadrons , 21 patrol squadrons and 18 aviation units to the Pacific .
On 30 July 1957 , the command added `` Naval '' to its title .
An important subordinate command for a long period was Commander , Fleet Air Keflavik , at what was Naval Air Station Keflavik , Iceland . Naval aviation has always played a large role in the operations at Keflavik , especially with regard to the enormous build-up of the Soviet Navy . Deployment of patrol squadron detachments , and later entire squadrons , started as early as 1951 , with the P-2 `` Neptune '' maritime patrol aircraft succeeded by the Lockheed P-3 `` Orion '' in the mid-1960s . In 1955 , Barrier Force , Atlantic had been established in Argentia , Newfoundland , flying radar early-warning missions using the WV-2 ( EC-121 Warning Star aircraft in the North Atlantic from 1957 . These aircraft made frequent deployments to Keflavik . On July 1 , 1961 , Commander Barrier Force , Atlantic moved from Argentia to Keflavik . The duties of Commander , Iceland Defense Force were assumed by the rear admiral commanding Barrier Force Atlantic .
In October 2001 , the Chief of Naval Operations placed Type Commanders in a `` Lead-Follow '' arrangement . Under this arrangement , COMNAVAIRPAC ( AIRLANT 's west coast counterpart ) became TYCOM for all Naval Aviation , and assumed the additional title of Commander , Naval Air Forces ( COMNAVAIRFOR ) . At that time , command of AIRLANT went from a 3-star/Vice Admiral to a 2-star Rear Admiral .
List of commanders
Subordinate Commands
Naval Air Force , U.S. Atlantic Fleet is composed of more than 40,000 men and women who maintain and operate the aircraft carriers , aircraft squadrons and aircraft of the Atlantic Fleet . It provides combat-ready air forces to fleet commanders operating around the globe .
Carrier Strike Groups
There are six Carrier Strike Group commanders who , although not under operational control of COMNAVAIRLANT , work very closely with the staff . CSG commanders are operationally responsible for the carrier , the embarked airwing and the cruisers that make up the battle group .
Carrier Strike Group Two ( George H.W . Bush Battle Group )
Carrier Strike Group Eight ( Eisenhower Battle Group )
Carrier Strike Group Three ( Truman Battle Group )
Carrier Strike Group Twelve ( Theodore Roosevelt Battle Group )
Aircraft Carriers
The nucleus of the surface battle group is the aircraft carrier . In the Atlantic Fleet , COMNAVAIRLANT has five carriers assigned to carry out the mission of COMLANTFLT and other commanders . One or two of these carriers are usually deployed with the U.S. Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea or with the U.S. Fifth Fleet in the Persian Gulf in support of U.S. Central Command . When not deployed or undergoing periodic maintenance/overhaul , or refresher training , these ships operate with United States Fleet Forces Command Task Force 80 in the Western Atlantic or U.S. Fourth Fleet in the Caribbean .

Pelym ( Пелым ) is a former town ( now a village ) on the bank of the Tavda River near its confluence with the Pelym River . It is part of Gari District , northeastern Sverdlovsk Oblast , Russia . In 2010 , the village had 78 inhabitants .
Once considered `` the gate to Siberia '' , Pelym owes its origin to a moving camp of Ablegirim , or Abdul Kerim , the last chieftain of the Vogul people . The Russians defeated him in an effort to pacify the Cherdyn Route , whereupon Ablegirim and his family were taken to Moscow as hostages . The fort of Pelym was built in 1592 on the site of his former residence by Prince Pyotr Gorchakov , a voivode from Cherdyn .
Pelym was one of the first Russian settlements east of the Urals , marking the eastern terminus of the Cherdyn Road from Europe . A makeshift timber fort was brought down the river from Upper Lozva to Pelym in 1597 . The builders took with them the family of Ignaty Khripunov—the first Russians to be exiled to Siberia .
After the discovery of the much shorter Babinov Road to Europe the town declined in importance . The tsarist government used it as a place of exile . The first political exiles were the people of Uglich implicated in the assassination of Tsarevich Demetrius . Other notable exiles included the paternal uncles of Tsar Michael I , Ernst Johann von Biron , and Burkhard Christoph von Münnich . Modern Pelym still has a penal colony .

Warship is a British television drama series produced by the BBC and broadcast between 1973 and 1977 . The series was set contemporaneously and depicted life on board the fictitious Royal Navy frigate HMS Hero . Four series were produced with 45 episodes made in total .
It was also subtitled into Dutch and broadcast in the Netherlands as Alle hens aan dek ( All hands on deck ) and it enjoyed popularity in Britain , Ireland , Australia , New Zealand and Singapore .
Plot
The episodes were written and filmed to reflect the reality of life in the Royal Navy and the Royal Marines in the 1970s . The primary focus for most stories was on the Captain and his fellow officers , but the series also featured life on the lower decks to portray episodes heavily featuring ratings . Episodes featured a variety of events at sea ( the Cold War , smuggling , the evacuation of civilians from crisis-hit places , etc . ) , as well as the personal lives of officers and ratings and the impact their personal lives had on their professional lives and duties .
Cast
Over the course of the series HMS Hero 's crew changes periodically . Only two officers , Kiley and Wakelin , remain with the ship for the whole series . The main characters in most episodes were the captain and his first lieutenant .

Royal Navy and Royal Australian Navy co-operation
The series enjoyed close collaboration between the Royal Navy and the BBC , and—unusually for a TV drama of the 1970s—looked like a documentary . Seven s played the role of HMS Hero and for continuity , all were repainted with the pennant number F42 of , the main warship used for filming . The others were , , , , and .
, a of the Royal Australian Navy , was also used as Hero for some scenes filmed in 1976 in Hong Kong and Singapore . This Australian link and Australian broadcasts of Warship influenced the production of the later and similar Australian Broadcasting Corporation series Patrol Boat .
The crews of these frigates - and Derwent - were given Hero cap tallies for filming purposes , and their ships were given HMS Hero ships ' badges , name plates and lifebuoys . Similarly , their Westland Wasp helicopters from the Fleet Air Arm 's 829 Naval Air Squadron were all repainted with the identification HMS Hero , the code 471 , and the nickname `` The Fighting Forty-Two '' . Among the Wasps used for the fictional Hero Flight were serial numbers XT419 from HMS Phoebes Flight , XV625 , and XV626 . ( One of these Wasps , XV625 still painted with the 471 code , is preserved at in the Royal Naval Air Engineering and Survival School . ) These measures , along with the use by all the frigates of the pennant number F42 , had the unintended side effect of confusing Soviet spy ships .
Other Royal Navy warships used for the series included the aircraft carrier , the helicopter cruiser , the commando carrier and the submarine . The Royal Marine Commandos took part in the series , as also did the Fleet Air Arm , the Royal Naval Reserve in the shape of the , the Royal Fleet Auxiliary in the shape of and other ships , and the Royal Maritime Auxiliary Service .
Fleet Air Arm squadrons embarked on HMS Ark Royal used for filming included the Buccaneer S 2s of 809 Naval Air Squadron and the Phantom FG 1s of 892 Naval Air Squadron . The Westland Wessex HU 5s of 845 Naval Air Squadron embarked on HMS Bulwark also featured in some episodes .
The series was also filmed ashore in , among other places , Gibraltar , Malta , Hong Kong , Singapore , north-east of Isfjellet in Loppa and Larvik in Norway , the Admiralty Experiment Works in Haslar , RNAS Predannack , Portland Harbour , Plymouth Dockyard , Portsmouth Dockyard and South Uist .
Theme music
The opening and closing music of the series were taken from a march called Warship , composed for the series by Anthony Isaac . The theme was played by the Band of the Royal Marines , Deal , conducted by Lieutenant Colonel Paul Neville , MVO , FRAM , RM . ( See links to files of opening and closing music below . )
The march is still played by Royal Marine bands and the Royal Australian Navy Band . The theme influenced the opening bars of a 2010 march , Scrap Iron Flotilla , composed by Leading Seaman Martyn Hancock of the Royal Australian Navy Band .
Warship was chosen as one of the pieces performed to mark the 75th and 100th anniversaries of the founding of the Royal Australian Navy Band . Writing in the Centenary Concert Music Program in 2013 , the Royal Australian Navy 's then-Director of Music , Lieutenant Commander Paul Cottier , said that :
`` Warship is a fine example of the influence television and film were having on the repertoire of military bands at that time , which were beginning to see a change in direction from military music and orchestral transcriptions to more popular and contemporary music . '' '
Series creators
The originator of the idea for the series and main script editor was a serving Royal Navy officer , Ian Mackintosh , who worked with BBC producer Anthony Coburn after Mackintosh originally approached the BBC in May 1971 . Coburn had for some years wanted to produce a series `` that would do for the Navy what Z-Cars had done for the Police '' . Apart from Mackintosh , other scriptwriters included Michael J. Bird , and the series was directed by Michael E. Briant among others . Mackintosh was seconded to the BBC for the series , and was awarded the MBE for his work on Warship in 1976 .
Warship and Blue Peter
In 1975 the BBC 's children 's television programme Blue Peter included a feature about the filming of Warship at Plymouth Dockyard aboard HMS Danae ; the item was presented by Lesley Judd . The next year , future Blue Peter presenter Peter Duncan played a major role in the episode `` All One Company '' . Six episodes of Warship were filmed aboard HMS Danae around that time .
Warship assessed in retrospect
Writing in 2006 , historian Professor S.P . MacKenzie judged that :
`` Warship had succeeded where Making Waves failed because those involved – the multi-talented Ian Mackintosh above all – managed to create varied and interesting characters and plots in which RN frigates and other vessels served as useful backdrops for the action . Warship , in short , helped the Royal Navy through a combination of competent writing , acting and direction rather more than through using its equipment as a showcase . ( ... ) Mackintosh and those around him knew how to draw in the viewer with stories that were both contemporary and interesting . '' ( Broadcasting the New Navy : the BBC-TV Series Warship ( 1973–1977 ) , p.119 )
`` Making Waves '' was a 2004 series made by ITV , and intended to be in the same vein as `` Warship '' . It proved less successful , and only three episodes were shown out of the six that were made .
In 2022 the British Forces Broadcasting Service noted that Warship was extremely popular ... and it is still fondly remembered to this day .

is a term used in traditional karate , meaning `` to annihilate at one blow '' . This , however , does not mean that any clash can and should be resolved with the use of only one stroke , but it conveys the spirit that the karateka ( player ) must partake in .
Traditionally , according to various practical applications of kata , karate was modeled so that a person could face more than one opponent simultaneously . However , with the advent of sports karate , this characteristic has been ignored , thus de-emphasising Ikken Hissatsu . Arduous training is required to effectively attain such a technique .
During a struggle , levels of epinephrine in the bloodstream are higher than normal , which can generate a false perception of reality , causing injuries to be felt well after its end .
Still new evidence using clinical data and articles have shown that some of the stories where Ikken Hissatsu was applied may have some truth . These sites are seen in injuries such as clipping the knees in football , in little league baseball when children are hit in the chest without protection causing commotio cordis .

Casa Anchieta is a building in San Cristóbal de La Laguna , Tenerife , Canary Islands . Originally constructed in the 16th century , the current building dates from the 17th century with 19th-century modifications . It was the childhood home of Saint Joseph of Anchieta , after whom the building is named . In 2020 the building started to be restored , with the aim of turning it into a museum and interpretation center about José de Anchieta .
History
The house is named after Joseph of Anchieta , who was born in San Cristóbal de La Laguna in 1534 , and resided in the building when he was in Tenerife , before going to Brazil .
The site was initially used as an elementary school at the start of the 16th century , which was turned into a single family home . It was originally the property of Nuño Pérez . When he died , his widow Mencia Díaz de Clavijo married Juan de Anchieta , a captain and public notary , who were the parents of José de Anchieta . While José de Anchieta was not born in the house , he lived in it for the first 14 years of his life .
The current building was constructed on top of it in the 17th century by Diego Benítez de Anchieta . It was significantly renovated in the 19th century , with the main facade remodeled in 1905 . It was also the residence of Manuel Verdugo , the Colegio Mayor Femnenino `` Virgen de la Candelaria '' was located in the building in 1962 , and the Escuela de Actores de Canarias was located in the building until 1987 .
It was recorded as a building of cultural interest on 14 March 1986 by Decree 50/1986 .
The building was restored in 2002-05 by the La Laguna City Council with the aim of creating a museum in the building . It then underwent a minor restoration in 2006 to temporarily house the Bishopric of Tenerife following a fire in the Salazar Palace until that building that was restored . From 2007 it was left abandoned and unused , except for briefly being used to store part of the municipal archive in 2015 until problems were detected in January 2016 .
In 2020 it was announced that a renovation will take place to turn it into a museum and interpretation centre focused on José de Anchieta . The restoration work will last 7 months and cost €710,000 . It will include making the building accessible to disabled people , with bathrooms on each floor and the installation of an elevator . The humidity that the building has suffered will be removed , and the internal layout revised to restore a more original layout . The work started in 2021 . By July it was reported that the work was mostly complete , particularly the most sensitive parts , but the remaining work needed some changes to the restoration plan - particularly the electricity supply , the elevator installation , and telecommunications .
Description
The neo-classical building is two storeys tall , with a tiled roof . It has a central courtyard with stairs on one side . It is trapezoid-shaped , and has three facades , the main one of which ( as well as the most important rooms ) faces onto Plaza del Adelantado . The front facade , which was originally asymmetric , was remodeled in 1905 by Mariano Estanga and is now symmetric with a central balcony . The main door and the balcony doors are dressed with stone . Window and door sills are made of iron balustrades . The side facade faces Calle Las Quinteras , while the rear faces a small square that used to house the building 's vegetable garden .
The interior was changed in the 19th and 20th centuries , but features from the 16th and 17th centuries can be seen in the walls , roof , trusses , and in the central courtyard and cellar .

The white-chinned jacamar ( Galbula tombacea ) is a species of bird in the family Galbulidae . It is found in Brazil , Colombia , Ecuador , and Peru .
Taxonomy and systematics
The white-chinned jacamar and the rufous-tailed ( Galbula ruficauda ) , bluish-fronted ( G. cyanescens ) , coppery-chested ( G. pastazae ) , and green-tailed jacamars ( G. galbula ) are considered to form a superspecies . The white-chinned jacamar has two subspecies , the nominate Galbula tombacea tombacea and G. t. mentalis .
Description
The white-chinned jacamar is long and weighs . The nominate male 's crown is ash brown and the rest of the upper parts are a dark metallic bronzy green . It has a small white chin spot , a glittery green throat and chest , and a reddish chestnut belly and vent area . The female 's belly is paler and ochraceous . G. t. mentalis has a larger white chin spot and the upper parts are a coppery bronze .
Distribution and habitat
The nominate subspecies of white-chinned jacamar is found east of the Andes from Colombia 's Meta Department southeast through Ecuador 's Napo Province and Peru 's Department of Loreto into western Brazil south of the Amazon River as far as the tonantins area of Amazonas state . G. t. mentalis is found further east , along both banks of the Solimões ( upper Amazon ) River to its confluences with the Negro and Madeira Rivers .
The white-chinned jacamar inhabits shrubby borders and openings in terra firme , várzea , and gallery forest . In lower elevations it is often found along watercourses . In elevation it ranges up to .
Behavior
Feeding
Though the white-chinned jacamar 's diet is assumed to include a variety of insects , only Hymenoptera have been recorded . It perches by itself or in pairs on exposed branches from which it sallies to catch its flying prey .
Breeding
`` No reliable information '' is available about the white-chinned jacamar 's breeding phenology .
Vocalization
The white-chinned jacamar 's song is `` an accelerating and rising series of “ pee-pee-pee-pee-pe-pe-pe-pe'pe'pe'pe ' e ' e ' notes '' ending with a trill . Its call is `` keelip '' or `` peeup '' , often given in a series .
Status
The IUCN has assessed the white-chinned jacamar as being of The Least Concern . Though it is widespread and occurs in several protected areas , it is rare to uncommon in most areas and `` deforestation doubtless continues to reduce population size . ''

Didcot Railway Centre is a railway museum and preservation engineering site in Didcot , Oxfordshire , England . The site was formerly a Great Western Railway engine shed and locomotive stabling point .
Background
The founders and commercial backers of the Great Western Railway ( GWR ) supported Isambard Kingdom Brunel 's scheme to develop an integrated railway and steamship service which allowed trans-Atlantic passengers and freight quicker passage between London and New York City . However , whilst backing the scheme the railway had to make a profit , and so it took a number of detours and added both mainline and branch line traffic to increase its domestic earnings . This earned the railway the nickname The Great Way Round from its detractors .
Whilst the route from London Paddington to Reading was relatively straight , the then obvious most direct route to Bristol would have taken the railway further south , thus avoiding both Didcot and Swindon . However , passenger and freight traffic both to and from Oxford and onwards to the West Midlands in part dictated a more northerly route . Also , Brunel had originally planned to cut through Savernake Forest near Marlborough , Wiltshire to Bristol , but the Marquess of Ailesbury , who owned the land , objected – having previously objected to part of the Kennet and Avon Canal running through his estate ( see Bruce Tunnel ) . With the railway needing to run near to a canal at its midpoint – as it was cheaper to transport coal for trains along canals at this time – and with the need for the branch northwards to Cheltenham via Stroud , Swindon was the next logical choice for the junction ( and later railway works ) , north of the original route . This dictated that the Oxford junction also be moved northwards , and hence via Didcot . The Great Western Railway built the first rail line through Didcot in 1839 and opened its first station in 1844 .
Construction
Due to the technical operational difficulties of running and maintaining a mainline service from London to Bristol , as well as the need for servicing locomotives going to Oxford , Didcot became an obvious midpoint maintenance and stabling point . Having built a timber-framed broad gauge shed on the original site during the railway 's development west in the 1800s , in June 1932 a new steel-framed half-brick 4-road through shed ( ) , was completed by the GWR under the Loans and Guarantees Act ( 1929 ) . With shed code DID , it also included a repair shop ( ) , coaling stage ( ) , sand furnace ( ) and turntable and associated offices ( ) . During World War II , a standard steel-framed with corrugated iron-panel covered ash shelter was erected .
Operations
After World War II , the site remained virtually unchanged during the nationalised ownership of British Railways ( BR ) , but for taking on the new code of 81E . The standard allocation of locomotives remained the same , with Halls , Dukedogs and Panniers making up the bulk of the depot 's fleet .
Closure
With the replacement of steam with diesel traction under the Modernisation Plan , the shed became redundant and was closed in June 1965 .
Formation and site lease
The Great Western Society ( GWS ) was offered the use of the former Didcot locomotive depot , taking it over in 1967 . In the 1970s , the society negotiated a long-term lease with BR which was to expire in 2019 . But this was subject to a six-month termination clause which could force the GWS to quit the site , and which could be operated at any point in time by lease-holder Network Rail ( NR ) .
In an attempt to secure a long-term future for the society , in 2002 the GWS opened negotiations with NR to either purchase the site or extend the lease . In a letter dated May 2007 , NR informed the GWS that they were prepared to sell the site subject to Office of Rail Regulation ( ORR ) approval . It had been thought the site could be subject to need as a depot , either due to : the rebuilding of Reading station ; a Crossrail project depot ; or the Intercity Express Programme . After expressing some concern at the slow speed of negotiations at the GWS annual meeting in September 2008 , NR wrote to the GWS to advise that the site was no longer available for sale , and although a lease extension was still on offer it was still subject to the previous six-month termination clause . The GWS then wrote to their local MP Ed Vaizey , and placed any long-term development plans on hold . Richard Croucher ( Chairman of the Great Western Society ) signed a new 50-year lease with Network Rail , therefore preserving the site for at least another 50 years .
Museum and railway centre
Today the GWS have developed the site , which still retains many of the original GWR buildings and features , as both a working steam locomotive and railway museum , engineering maintenance centre , and railway line offering short rides to visitors .
Access via Didcot Parkway station brings the visitor into the southern end of the site , at the start of the ramp coal wagons would take up to the coaling stage . Beyond this is the original 1932 four-road engine shed , and beyond this the original repair shed and 1988 constructed locomotive works , both of which have restricted access due to safety concerns . Beyond this lies a Ransomes & Rapier turntable and pit , originally built for the Southern Railway and installed at Southampton Docks .
The centre regularly holds events such as steam and diesel railcar days . Members of the Great Western Society are active in the preservation of locomotives and rolling stock . Certain 'new-build ' projects to create locomotives that did not escape wholesale scrapping are also undertaken at Didcot , such as the completed Firefly locomotive , a 'Saint ' class ( using a 'Hall ' class chassis and boiler ) and a 'County ' class locomotive ( using a 'Hall ' class chassis and an LMS '8F ' class boiler ) .
The Railway Centre is used a period film set and has featured in works including Anna Karenina , Sherlock Holmes : A Game of Shadows , and The Elephant Man .
Running lines
There are three short lengths of running track , each with a station at both ends :
Branchline : starts at a typical GWR wayside halt , named Didcot Halt , and runs north on the western edge of the site to a platform , named Burlescombe Station , at the transshipment shed . Dating from broad gauge days , the shed was used for transferring goods from broad to `` narrow '' ( i.e . ) rolling stock and vice versa . It was moved to its present location carefully from its original site nearby .
Broad Gauge Line : the broad gauge line of starts from the transshipment shed , and runs halfway back down the branchline . The 2005 replica GWR Firefly is housed within the shed when not running
Mainline : starts from the Main Line Platform opposite the site entrance , using a pre-fabricated concrete station platform from , and runs on the eastern-edge of the site to a newly built platform , named Oxford Road Station , near the transshipment shed . Long-term plans include the reconstruction of the Brunel-designed building from station on this platform .
Access
The railway centre is entirely surrounded by active railway lines and has no road connection of any kind . Public access is on foot from a subway at Didcot Parkway station , which links the centre by rail to London and much of southern and central England . Wheelchair and pram access is practically nonexistent ; they have to be carried up a flight of concrete steps . Although this contravenes the Disability Discrimination Act , the Great Western Society is unable to improve it since the site is owned by Network Rail .

Other rolling stock
The GWS has an extensive supporting collection of GWR rolling stock , including three of the GWR Super Saloons that serviced the boat train traffic to Plymouth .

Cyclonic Storm Rashmi ( IMD designation : BOB 05 , JTWC designation : 04B ) was the seventh tropical cyclone of the 2008 North Indian Ocean cyclone season and second cyclonic storm , as well as the fifth tropical cyclone in the Bay of Bengal that year . A fairly weak tropical cyclone , it caused some notable damage in Bangladesh and India .
An area of low pressure formed within the Bay of Bengal on October 24 . It was designated as Depression BOB 05 the next day by the India Meteorological Department . The depression was declared a deep depression early on October 26 , whilst the Joint Typhoon Warning Center designated the depression as Cyclone 04B later that day with wind speeds equivalent to a tropical storm . Later that day , the IMD upgraded the deep depression into a cyclonic storm and named it as Rashmi . Rashmi then reached both its peak one- and three-minute sustained wind speeds , as it made landfall on the Bangladesh coast late on October 26 . Early the next day the JTWC issued its final advisory on Rashmi as the IMD downgraded Rashmi to a deep depression . Later that day the IMD , having noted that Rashmi had weakened rapidly , downgraded the deep depression to a well marked area of low pressure and released their final advisory .
The name Rashmi was submitted by Sri Lanka , to the World Meteorological Organisation 's Tropical Cyclone Committee . Rashmi ( pronounced Rush-mee ) is a Sinhalese word , which means `` ray of light '' .
Meteorological history
On October 24 , 2008 , an area of low pressure formed in the North Indian Ocean , within the central Bay of Bengal . Later that day the Joint Typhoon Warning Center , designated it as a Tropical Disturbance and assessed its chances of forming into a significant tropical cyclone within the next 24 hours as fair . The next day as the India Meteorological Department reported that the disturbance had intensified into a depression and assigned the number BOB 05 to the depression . The JTWC then upgraded the depression 's chances of forming into a significant cyclone to Good and issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the depression .
Early on October 26 the IMD upgraded the depression to a deep depression , with wind speeds of 30 knots ( 35 mph , 55 km/h ) . At the same time the JTWC designated the depression as Cyclone 04B . Later that day the IMD reported that the Deep Depression had intensified into a Cyclonic Storm with it being named as Rashmi . During that evening the IMD reported that Rashmi had reached its peak 3 minute wind speeds of 40 knots , whilst the JTWC also reported that Rashmi had reached its peak 1 minute wind speeds of 45 knots .
Early the next day the IMD reported that Rashmi had made landfall on the Bangladesh coast , near Barisal . As a result of making landfall Rashmi started to weaken rapidly by becoming a Deep Depression , early that morning before being downgraded to a well marked area of low pressure , later during the morning .
Preparations and impact
India
Five people were killed as incessant rains accompanied by winds hit the state of Meghalaya , India . The cyclone 's incessant rainfall accompanied by gusty winds had caused flash floods in three districts of Assam - Kamrup , Sonitput and inundated vast tracts of land besides rendering people homeless . The flash floods occurred as neighbouring Bhutan and Arunachal Pradesh released excess waters from their reservoirs due to increased water levels caused by incessant rains for the last two days by cyclone Rashmi
Bangladesh
The Disaster Management Information Centre in Bangladesh issued cyclone warnings for various ports in Bangladesh including the Port of Mongla . As a result of these cyclone warnings , harbour activities were suspended for two days .
15 people were killed and thousands of homes were also damaged . Rashmi brought down electrical and telephone poles and uprooted trees ; large areas of acres of crops were also destroyed . At least 50 fishermen were reported missing when about 15 fishing trawlers capsized offshore .

The Man Machine Poem Tour was a concert tour by The Tragically Hip in support of their thirteenth full-length studio album Man Machine Poem . The tour consisted of 15 shows , the first held on July 22 , 2016 , in Victoria , British Columbia , and the last held on August 20 , 2016 , at the Rogers K-Rock Centre in Kingston , Ontario .
The tour was announced on May 25 , 2016 , following an announcement the previous day regarding singer Gord Downie 's brain cancer diagnosis . A portion of the proceeds of the tour were donated to the Sunnybrook Foundation , the independent fundraising arm of the Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre ; in addition to the ticket sale proceeds themselves , both Sunnybrook and the Canadian Cancer Society reported a significant increase in direct donations , totalling over one million dollars , from the public during the tour . CBC broadcast the tour 's final concert in Kingston on its radio , television , and digital platforms , which was seen by 11.7 million viewers across all platforms , and a DVD and Blu-ray of the concert was released in December 2017 .
Although generally reported by the media as such , at the time the band refrained from officially labeling the concerts as their farewell tour , and instead communicated the hope that Downie 's health would remain stable enough for them to tour again in the future . However , Downie died of the illness on October 17 , 2017 . In July 2018 , guitarist Rob Baker declared that the Tragically Hip were now inactive and the members had no plans to perform under the name again without Downie .
Cultural analysis
Throughout the summer , the nature of the tour resulted in a considerable volume of analysis of the band , the tour and its impact on Canadian culture appearing in the media . This included a number of international outlets which had never before devoted significant coverage to the band , including CNN , BBC News , The Guardian and The New Yorker .
Canadian media outlets which would ordinarily only publish reviews of local concerts published an ongoing series of reviews of every stop on the tour , including unusually thorough analysis of the setlists .
The newsmagazine Maclean 's published interviews throughout the summer with other musicians and cultural figures who had been friends , fans , collaborators or tourmates of the band , including Jim Cuddy of Blue Rodeo , Geoffrey Kelly of Spirit of the West , John K. Samson of The Weakerthans , Dave Bidini of Rheostatics , Peter Garrett of Midnight Oil , novelist Joseph Boyden , singer-songwriters Joel Plaskett and Sarah Harmer , and record producer Steve Berlin .
Both Maclean 's and the Toronto Star also sent journalists to the town of Bobcaygeon , Ontario to explore the impact of one of the Tragically Hip 's most famous songs , `` Bobcaygeon '' .
Ticket sales controversy
Due to the news of Downie 's cancer diagnosis , demand for tickets was higher than for any of the band 's concert tours since the 1990s . However , many fans ended up stymied by ticket scalpers ; even in the advance presale to members of the band 's fan club , all available tickets were sold out within minutes , and many tickets almost immediately began showing up on resale sites such as StubHub , at inflated prices of up to $ 5,000 for the Kingston show , and up to $ 1,300 for most other shows . The same occurred when general market tickets were released ; in some cities , the general release tickets were entirely sold out less than one minute after going on sale . One scalper even set up a dedicated domain , thehiptickets.com .
The band described themselves as sad and concerned by the situation , but noted that ticket sales were largely out of their own control . They responded by adding further shows to the tour , and by redesigning the planned stage configuration in order to release additional seats . Ontario 's provincial government announced plans to review its regulations around ticket sales , and two scalpers were arrested in Winnipeg . The public outcry led CBC Television to explore options for broadcast of the Kingston show , and also resulted in a record number of booking requests for the Practically Hip , a long-running Tragically Hip tribute band , to play private Tragically Hip tribute parties across Canada .
Jesse Modz , a DJ for CHTZ-FM in St. Catharines , Ontario , aired a segment on his radio show in which he fooled a scalper in Mississauga into driving to St. Catharines by offering a $ 300 premium on top of the asking price ; when the scalper arrived , Modz did not purchase the tickets , but rather confronted him about the ethics of scalping .
Canadian music journalist Alan Cross called the situation `` the most cold-blooded , market-driven display of capitalism that we 've ever seen involving Canadian concerts . ''
In October 2016 , Live Nation Entertainment formally admitted for the first time that at least two-thirds of all tickets for the tour were snapped up by ticket brokers , leaving less than one-third of the tickets available to be purchased at face value by fans .
In February 2017 , the government of Ontario formally announced that it would introduce legislation to ban `` scalper bots '' .
Final concert
The final show on the tour was held on August 20 , 2016 at the Rogers K-Rock Centre in the band 's hometown of Kingston . The concert was simulcast in a special , The Tragically Hip : A National Celebration , airing commercial-free across the CBC 's television and radio outlets , including CBC Television , CBC Radio One and CBC Radio 2 , as well as on Sirius XM satellite radio , and online via CBC Music and YouTube . CBC broke away from its second-last night of primetime coverage of the 2016 Summer Olympics to air the concert ; Ron Maclean hosted a short introduction from Rio de Janeiro , where the Canadian Olympic athletes were themselves gathered for a viewing party at Canada House . At the end of the introduction , Maclean said : `` We now go to this late breaking story on the CBC '' referencing not only the concert itself but a lyric from the Tragically Hip song `` Wheat Kings '' . The concert was attended by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau upon request by the band .
At least 11.7 million watched part of the concert across these platforms ; 4.3 million were watching the television broadcast , while precise breakdowns of radio listeners , online streaming viewers or attendees at public screening parties have not been released . Public viewing was also set up in Kingston at the Springer Market Square and attended by approximately 22,000 people . Many other towns and cities across Canada also hosted public broadcasts of the concert . One particularly noted example was in Bobcaygeon , which held a public viewing on its main street ; in addition to local residents , the event was also attended by a significant number of people who had made a `` pilgrimage '' to view the concert there because of the song .
On the same night as the Kingston concert , American rock band Pearl Jam were performing in Chicago ; lead singer Eddie Vedder paid tribute to Downie and dedicated a performance of `` Light Years '' to Downie and the Tragically Hip . Canadian band Blue Rodeo were also performing a previously scheduled concert in Toronto on the same night ; during that show , they performed a rendition of `` Bobcaygeon '' as video screens around the venue displayed scenes from the concurrent Hip concert in Kingston . Longtime Blue Rodeo guitarist and mandolinist Bob Egan , who was retiring from music and performing his final show with the band that evening , had been a guest musician on the original Tragically Hip recording of the song .
The CBC aired an encore of the concert on June 24 , 2017 .
The Kingston concert was released on DVD in December 2017 , under the title A National Celebration . The DVD was released both on its own and as a box set with the documentary film Long Time Running .
In 2020 , Cineplex Entertainment announced that select Canadian theatres would run a double bill of A National Celebration and Long Time Running in the week of September 18 as a special event .
Honours
The tour resulted in Downie being selected by the Canadian Press as its Canadian Newsmaker of the Year for 2016 . This marked the first time in the award 's history that a musician was chosen . Downie 's death resulted in his being selected as Newsmaker of the Year again in 2017 .
At the 5th Canadian Screen Awards , the CBC 's broadcast of the final concert was nominated for and won six awards , including Best Live Entertainment Special , Best Direction in a Variety or Sketch Comedy Program or Series ( David Russell ) , Best Production Design or Art Direction in a Non-Fiction Program or Series ( Brent Clark ) , Best Photography in a Variety Program or Series ( Alex Nadon and Tyler Pigeon ) , Best Sound in a Variety or Animated Program or Series ( Jay Vicari , Peter Gary , Jon Erickson , Lee Moro and Mark Vreeken ) , and Best Performance in a Variety or Sketch Comedy Program or Series ( The Tragically Hip ) .
The band and the tour are the subjects of Jennifer Baichwal and Nicholas de Pencier 's documentary film Long Time Running , which premiered at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival .
Tour dates
Setlists
The setlist for each show was different . Typically the band played 20 or 21 songs followed by a three-song encore and then an additional two-song encore . For the final show , the band played 21 songs and then returned to play three encores of three songs each .
At virtually all shows , all songs from the same album were performed consecutively in sets of two , three or four , with that album not subsequently returned to for the rest of the show . Only a few times over the course of the tour was this pattern deviated from at all , normally for just one song .
The only unplayed album on the tour was their debut EP The Tragically Hip . No song in the band 's catalogue was performed at all 15 shows ; the band 's 1990s signature songs `` Ahead by a Century '' , `` Bobcaygeon '' and `` Poets '' , and their more recent single `` What Blue '' , were the most-played songs overall , having been performed at all but one or two of the shows .

Llangower was a minor station opened by the GWR on the Ruabon to Barmouth line in 1929 on the southern shore of Bala Lake serving the hamlet of Llangower .
There was no signal box or freight facility , just a short platform and a waiting shelter on the south side of the line . Today , although not in its original location the station has been reopened 350m to the west ( on the north side of the line ) by the Bala Lake Railway and is the main intermediate point on the line and the only place where trains can pass each other . It is well sited to provide access to the lakeside for walks , picnics and bird watching .
The station has a single platform , with the passing loop located to the east of the platform . When two trains are in service , they must use the station in turn , with the second train remaining in the loop until called forward after the first train has departed . The points and signals at the station are operated from a ground frame , housed in a ground frame shelter .
In the spring of 2017 and thanks to a significant donation collected in memory of “ Pip , The Railway Dog ” - faithful companion to a volunteer and supporter of the railway , the station received refurbishment with a new picket fence and running in board .
Llangower is a small hamlet , with a beautiful old church , 3 miles from Bala situated on the south-eastern side of Bala lake . It is on the ( original ) turnpike-road leading from Dinas-Mawddwy to Bala and Corwen .

The Toukley Hawks are an Australian rugby league football youth club based in the suburb of Toukley on the Central Coast of NSW . They have numerous teams competing in competitions run by the Central Coast Division of Country Rugby League , from U/7s through to First Grade . The Hawks ' current home ground is Darren Kennedy Oval and their traditional colours are blue and gold . Toukley reached their maiden first grade Grand Final in 2022 and won against the Erina Eagles 20-10 , their first premiership since the club began in 1967 .
History
Toukley began as a junior rugby league club in 1967 . In 1971 , when Group 12 Schoolboys switched from weight limit teams to age limit teams , Toukley fielded a side in each age group from Under 8 to Under 14 , although not in Under 15 .
When a Second Division competition commenced in 1976 , Toukley entered a team . The Hawks ' were competitive in their inaugural season of senior football and reached the semi-finals . The following year , Toukley finished at the top of the table , then defeated Milson Island in a major-semi-final and Wyong in a Grand Final , to claim the Second Division premiership .
Toukley switched to First Division in 1979 and entered teams in First Grade , Second Grade , Third Grade , Under 19s and Under 17s . During the 1980s , Toukley 's appearances in finals football were limited . The Hawks were Second Grade Grand Finalists in 1981 and Under 18 Semi-finalists in 1985 , 1988 and 1989 .
In 1991 Toukley qualified for the finals series in Third , Second and , for the first time , First Grade . Sadly for the club , all finals matches were lost by small margins . In Third Grade Toukley had led 8–0 after twenty minutes , but The Entrance won 22–16 . In Second Grade , Erina led 18–0 , before a rally by the Hawks saw the scores level , 20-all at full time . Two tries by Erina in the second period of extra-time denied Toukley , 28–20 being the final score . One week later , Toukley met Erina in the First Grade major semi-final . The 6-all half-time score , was broken by an Erina field goal . A later try was added by the Eagles , to beat the Hawks 11–6 . Toukley then met Woy Woy in the preliminary final . Despite dominating possession and field position in the first twenty minutes , Toukley trailed 12–2 at half-time . A try , conversion and later penalty goal by Toukley reduced the margin to two points , but Woy Woy kicked away with an unconverted try and subsequent field goal . Final score , 17–10 .
In 1995 Toukley dropped out of First Division and returned to Second Division , which came to be known as the Saturday League . The number of wins each season increased over the ensuing seasons , culminating in a Grand Final win over the Peninsula Raiders in 1998 . The match was scoreless for 76 minutes , at which point the Raiders landed a field goal . Toukley responded in the last minute , `` On the fourth tackle the ball went out the backline until lock and captain Mark Burns had to regather a sloppy pass . In desperation Burns passed back inside to David Sant , who sped through a gap '' and `` crashed over beside the posts '' . The try was converted , 6–1 the full time score .
Toukley 's success in the Saturday League continued in 1999 as they reached the Grand Final undefeated . The Hawks led early and again late in the second half , prior to a penalty goal by opponents Budgewoi taking the score to 14-all at full time . Toukley scored a converted try early in extra-time and held on to win , 20–14 .
Toukley and Budgewoi met again in the 2000 Grand Final . A strong performance in the first half saw the Hawks cross for five tries and lead 22–0 at the break . The Bulldogs rallied and a second try with nine minutes to go , brought them within ten points . Toukley , however , held firm to win 22–12 , and claim a third successive Saturday League title .
Budgewoi players and supporters must have derived both satisfaction and relief when they defeated Toukley in the minor semi-final of 2001 , ending the Hawk 's season . Budgewoi went on to win the Grand Final .
After finishing seventh in 2002 , Toukley returned to the final series in 2003 . The second division competition was now known as the Ken Cosgrove Cup . Losing the major semi-final to defending premiers Central Wyong ( 10–20 ) , Toukley recovered with a win over Gosford Cougars , 38–14 , to set-up a rematch . Trailing by six points for much of the second half , `` a try to fullback Daniel Lewis with 13 seconds remaining followed by a storming performance in extra-time propelled the Toukley Hawks to grand final glory . '' Two unconverted tries were added by Toukley , to win 24–16 .
Toukley had strong seasons in the Ken Cosgrove Cup in 2004 and 2005 , finishing as losing Finalists in both years . In 2006 , local Rugby League was reorganised and the second division competition was discontinued . Toukley entered teams in First Grade , Second Grade and Under 17s and finished in sixth or seventh place in each competition .
The club has fielded a team in many of the senior-level competitions since , and reached three lower grade grand finals : Under 17s and the inaugural Open Age league in 2010 and Under 18/1s in 2012 .
In 2015 and 2016 Toukley fielded teams in First Grade , Reserve Grade , Open Age and in Ladies League Tag . In 2017 , the club also entered an Under 19 team , competing in all five senior competitions . In 2017 the club has fielded 23 junior teams , from Under 6 's to Under 17 's , an increase of six teams from 2016 , and the most in the club 's 50 year history .

Reception
In a contemporary review , John J. O'Connor of The New York Times found two weaknesses with the series ; it was `` too long '' for the source material and he thought the characters too stereotypical . O'Connor thought highly of the cast and although there were flaws he wrote `` this is a production obviously involving uncommon intelligence . Extraordinary care has been taken on all levels . '' He summarized : `` It often demands patience , but attention will be rewarded with touches of rare insight . ''

Puliyakot Keshava Menon ( 1917 – 22 October 1979 ) was an Indian mathematician best known as Director of the Joint Cipher Bureau .
His sudden demise on 22 October 1979 , ended active research in the areas of number theory , combinatorics , algebra and cryptography .
Early life
P. Kesava Menon was born ( 1917 ) in Alathur , which is now part of the Palakkad District of Kerala state in India . His mother , Devaky Amma , hailed from the Kunissery Puliyakot family and , as per custom , Kesava Menon took his family name from his mother . His father , A K Krishnan Unni Kartha , hailed from Aiyiloor in the Palghat district . Menon grew up on Alathur under his uncle 's supervision and hence his primary and high school education was conducted in modest surrounding at Alathur itself .
Higher education
As was the custom for bright students from landed families those days , Menon had to travel to Madras city and join the Madras Christian College for his higher studies . There , he completed his MA in Mathematics and was awarded a scholarship to pursue research under the guidance of Prof R Vaidyanathaswamy . In 1941 , the University of Madras awarded him a MSc Degree with a thesis entitled `` Contributions to the theory of multiplicative arithmetic functions '' .
Educator
Thereafter he was appointed lecturer at the Annamalai University , where he served for two years , before joining the staff of Madras Christian College again as a professor and warden of Seliyur Hall . He was devoted to his research work along with teaching , and , in 1948 , he submitted his dissertation on `` Contributions to the theory of numbers '' for which he was conferred the highest and rarest degree of Doctor of Science ( DSc ) .
He theorized and published the classical inequality theory , which is today known as `` Kesava Menon 's classical inequality theorem ''
He published a paper on the subject of the continued fraction of the mathematician Ramanujan , as noted here in the Journal of the London Mathematical Society

The Islands are the collective name for the set of large islands south of Cape Cod in the southeast corner of the U.S. state of Massachusetts : Nantucket , Martha 's Vineyard , the Elizabeth Islands , and a small number of minor islands . The Islands are the location of numerous beach resorts , celebrity second homes , and preserved buildings dating back to the whaling era .
Geography
Nantucket Island ( together with the two smaller islands of Tuckernuck and Muskeget ) constitutes the town of Nantucket ; the Elizabeth Islands constitute the town of Gosnold ; and Martha 's Vineyard contains the towns of Edgartown , Oak Bluffs , Tisbury ( including Vineyard Haven ) , West Tisbury , Chilmark , and Aquinnah . They are separated from Cape Cod by Nantucket Sound and Vineyard Sound , and from the South Coast by Buzzards Bay .
History
The disputed territory of the Islands came under absolute British control following the English acquisition of the former Dutch colony of New Amsterdam . The Islands were established as Dukes County , New York in 1683 , and then in 1691 they were transferred from New York to Massachusetts and then separated into two counties : Nantucket County ( consisting of Nantucket alone ) and Dukes County , containing all the other islands .
Originally the home of indigenous Wampanoag , the area was otherwise inhabited by only a few landlords and seafaring families until a brief golden era when local population and wealth grew immensely as a result of the Islands being the home of many commercial whalers and their crews , due to demand for blubber for use in oil lamps . The whale oil market became obsolete following the development of modern petroleum extraction , with dire consequences for local sailors and merchants , until the area was discovered as a summer colony , first by wealthy visitors from mainland New England and later from around the country and beyond . Much of the isolated rural culture of the Islands has been preserved from new construction , partly because they can be easily accessed only by ferry or aircraft due to their separation from the rest of the state by Vineyard Sound and Nantucket Sound .
Although the arrival of large numbers of people as well as new homes , retailers , and restaurants has led to rising costs for many long-time residents , the unique local lifestyle is still visible in part by an occasionally emerging secession movement of variable strength .
Attractions
Attractions on the Islands include Flying Horses Carousel , Cape Poge Wildlife Refuge , Polly Hill Arboretum , and Troubled Shores supplemented by ample opportunities for cycling , equestrianism , fishing , sailing , and some of the finest whale watching in the world .
People associated with the Islands
The Islands have been a part of the lives of many noted personalities , including Mary Morrill , Mayhew Folger , Lucretia Mott , Rowland Hussey Macy , Walter Cronkite , William Styron , William Labov , Ted Kennedy , David McCullough , and Carly Simon .

Avalanche : The Salerno Landings is a board wargame published by Game Designers ' Workshop ( GDW ) in 1976 that simulates the nine-day battle for the beachhead at Salerno in September 1943 following the Allied amphibious landing known as Operation Avalanche .
Historical background
Following the Allied invasion of Italy from Sicily in 1943 , German defenders were successfully delaying the British 8th Army from advancing north . In an attempt to outflank the German defenders , General Mark Clark 's Fifth Army landed at Salerno , about 20 miles south of Naples , on September 9 . `` Operation Avalanche '' , as it was called , pitted the Allies trying to break out of the beachhead against the German defenders , who strove to destroy the landing forces before they could link up with the British 8th Army .
Description
Avalanche : The Salerno Landings is a tactical , company-level simulation of Operation Avalanche . Reviewer Geoff Barnard called it the first `` tactical/operational '' wargame .
Components
The game components include :
Two 22 ” x 28 ” hex grid maps ( with Turn Record Chart and Terrain Key incorporated ) scaled at 1300 yds ( 1190 m ) per hex
960 ½ ” cardboard Counters ( includes armor , armored infantry , motorized infantry , paratroops , glider troops , commandos , infantry , artillery , antiaircraft , antitank , engineers , naval , and information markers )
5½ ” x 8½ ” 20-page rulebook
two 8½ ” x 11 ” Allied charts and two 8½ ” x 11 ” German charts
5½ ” x 8½ ” sheet of Errata ( dated July 20 , 1976 )
6-sided die
“ Zip-Lock ” Bag ( 1st edition ) or box ( all subsequent printings ) to hold components
Gameplay
The game is designed for two players ( or two teams ) , one taking the Allied side trying to successfully break out of the Salerno beachhead , and the other playing the German defenders who are trying to either throw the Allies back into the sea , or inflict maximum casualties on the Allies . The game is scaled to 8 hours per game turn ( morning , afternoon and night of each day . ) The game lasts from the start of the landings on 9 September 1943 to 17 September 1943 when Allied reinforcements arrive , a total of 25 turns .
During each turn , both sides have an opportunity for player movement , simultaneous artillery fire , and combat .
In addition to the main historical simulation , the rules also include four optional `` what if '' scenarios using different orders of battles , different reinforcement arrivals and improved German supply capability .
Victory conditions
The Allies are victorious if a given number of units can successfully break out of the beachhead area , or if they can survive until their reinforcements arrive on September 17 . The Germans win if they can prevent enough Allied units from breaking out of the beachhead , or if they can destroy the Allies before September 17 .
Publication history
The game was designed by Frank Chadwick , with graphic design by Rich Banner . It was published by GDW in 1976 .
Reception
In his 1977 book The Comprehensive Guide to Board Wargaming , Nicholas Palmer called this game `` highly sophisticated in land combat , with one of the most advanced simulations of special unit functions appearing in any game yet published . '' Although he admired the `` Numerous special-function units , attractive board , clear rules , interesting choice of strategies for both sides , '' he warned that games were `` very long ( up to 50 hours or so ) . '' He did not like `` stacking rules requiring irritating checks on the battalion affiliations of each stack . '' He concluded that the game was `` Marvellous for lovers of complex , realistic games , but frightful for a beginner . '' In his 1980 sequel , The Best of Board Wargaming , Palmer added `` The game does suffer from some minor historical errors [ ... ] but these do not affect play . ''
In Issue 19 of Phoenix ( May/June 1979 ) , Rob Gibson recommended this game for more experienced players due to its complexity , but suggested that in a team situation , beginners could be given command of a small unit in order to learn the rules . Gibson felt that `` On the whole , this is an excellent simulation of a very complex and confused battle and well worth learning the rules to play . '' He concluded , `` This is one of the best simulations of an amphibious operation I have come across so far — well worth buying and very rewarding to play . Highly recommended . ''
In a retrospective review in Issue 32 of Phoenix ( July-August 1981 ) , Geoff Barnard wrote `` For its day Avalanche contained many rules and ideas which ought to have been in other games . '' However , he pointed out that in terms of historical accuracy , `` as time has gone by , accumulated play experience and piled up historical research has made it increasingly obvious that Avalanche is severely wanting . '' Barnard , who is British , found the details about the British contribution to the battle to be largely inaccurate . He also pointed out that an entire German artillery regiment was missing . However , he concluded `` I still feel that [ Avalanche ] has my essential ingredient for a wargame , historical interest . It is the sort of game you can study , that gives those players who are interested in more than just what is going on , something to ponder rather than merely shuffling counters and counting factors . ''
Awards
At the 1977 Origins Awards , Avalanche won the Charles S. Roberts Award for `` Best Graphics and Physical Systems of 1976 . ''

The Gordon Aikman Lecture Theatre is a category B listed performing arts and lecture theatre located in the historic George Square in Edinburgh . Primarily operated as a lecture theatre for the University of Edinburgh , it is also used for general theatre performances , as well as being a designated Edinburgh Fringe Festival venue .
In 2018 the University changed the name of the theatre - previously known as George Square Theatre - in memory of Gordon Aikman , a graduate of the University 's Business School who raised more than £500,000 for research funding into motor neurone disease .
Construction of the Modernist style theatre was completed in 1970 , and opened to the general public the same year . Its seating capacity of 481 makes it the University 's largest lecture facility , and an asset to the busy Edinburgh Festival Fringe . Since 2011 , and while a venue for the Fringe , the theatre was under the branding of Assembly Group , an events promotion company responsible for the operation of Edinburgh 's main Fringe venues , which had moved from their original base at George Street in the city . Subsequently , during the Festival the theatre was branded Assembly George Square Theatre .
The theatre 's location has allowed its use and popularity to increase , being situated near the Quartermile district development in the grounds of the old Edinburgh Royal Infirmary , along with the building and development of new University of Edinburgh facilities . The theatre can also be seen and accessed from The Meadows , a large park popular with tourists and students .
Due to the building 's striking stand-alone appearance , it has been a popular location for filming and productions , with the facade often changed to suit different purposes .

Campethera is a genus of bird in the family Picidae , or woodpeckers , that are native to sub-Saharan Africa . Most species are native to woodland and savanna rather than deep forest , and multiple species exhibit either arboreal or terrestrial foraging strategies . Its nearest relative is the monotypic genus Geocolaptes of southern Africa , which employs terrestrial foraging and breeding strategies . They are however not close relatives of similar-looking woodpeckers in the `` Dendropicos clade '' .
Taxonomy
The genus Campethera was introduced by the English zoologist George Robert Gray in 1841 with the little green woodpecker ( Campethera maculosa ) as the type species . The generic name combines the Ancient Greek kampē meaning `` caterpillar '' and -thēras meaning `` hunter '' .
Species diversity in the `` Campethera clade '' is believed to be understated , and up to 18 species may be involved . The following 11 species are currently recognized :
Description
They are small to medium-sized woodpeckers . The sexes are fairly similar , but males of most species have the crown and nape bright red , while in females this is restricted to the nape . Colour of the malar plumage is also useful in sexing .
Their plumage pattern is fairly uniform , and some species are only distinguishable by careful observation . The mantle , back and wings are olive-greenish , and usually spotted or barred in buffy to golden yellow . The shafts of the remiges and rectrices are yellow to golden yellow . The underpart plumage is spotted black to a lesser or greater degree .
Some species include drumming on dead wood as a means of non-vocal signaling . Most species are poor drummers however , and some species may not drum at all .
Foraging
Their rectrices are only partially stiffened ( for arboreal support ) , and they readily take to terrestrial foraging . Ants and termites form important components of their diet . These are lapped up with a flexible and sticky tongue .

Totley is a suburb on the extreme southwest of the City of Sheffield , in South Yorkshire , England . Lying in the historic county boundaries of Derbyshire , Totley was amalgamated into the city of Sheffield in 1933 , and is today part of the Dore and Totley electoral ward in the city , though it remains close to the contemporary county boundary of Derbyshire . Totley had a population of 7,963 in 2011 . Totley was shown at the 2011 census as being part of the ward of Dore and Totley .
Totley was mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Totinglee , the name meaning a forest clearing belonging to Tota ( probably the Saxon lord ) . Totley Hall , built in 1623 and enlarged in the 19th century , was converted to a teacher training college in the 1950s and was latterly part of Sheffield Hallam University .
Through the district run the Totley Brook and the Old Hay Brook , which are the two sources of the River Sheaf . Totley also lends its name to Totley Tunnel , the longest underland rail tunnel in the United Kingdom . This takes the Sheffield to Manchester line from Totley underneath the Totley Moor to Grindleford in Derbyshire .
History and geography
Totley was first referred to in the Domesday Survey , commissioned by William the Conqueror . It was then referred to as Totinglei .
It has since had many a different spelling :
1086 Totinglei
1221 Totenleg
1234 Totingly
1275 Tottle
1293 Totleye
1320 Toteleye
1476 Tottynley
1487 Totteley
1585 Tottley
1629 Totles
1641 Tottingley
The Domesday book says this :
- In Totinglei , Tolf had IV bovates of land hidable . Land for one plough . It is waste , wood , pasturable , 1 mile in length and half a mile in breadth . T.R.E . value X shillings now XII pence .
The area of Totley in 1086 was quite small , but by 1839 had grown seven-fold . The borders of Totley are agreed to be the Old Hay Brook , Totley Brook , Brown Edge , Lady Cross , Stony Ridge , along Hathersage Road and Blacka Dike .
The lowest point is the junction between Old Hay Brook and Totley Brook ( beginning of the River Sheaf ) at 400 ft , the highest point is Flask Edge at 1300 ft .
The underground is rich , and Totley Brick Works still produce bricks and ceramics to this day .
At one time , Totley was one of the townships in the Hundred of Scarsdale , a sub-division of the county of Derbyshire . In 1934 Totley , along with Dore and Bradway became part of Hallam Ward , part of the City of Sheffield and the West Riding of Yorkshire .
Totley is made of Totley Village ( Hillfoot Road and Totley Hall Lane ) , Totley Moor ( unpopulated ) , Totley Bents ( Penny Lane ) , New Totley ( called as such since the 30s ) and Totley Rise ( Baslow Road shops and Lower Bradway Bank ) .
Cannon Hall
Although there is little proof , there are assumptions that the hall was present in 829 . One hypothesis concerning the name of the hall is that it once belonged to the Canons of Beauchief . Parish and council records show that the Pearsons family has lived in Totley since at least 1550 and still live in the village . Samuel Pearson farmed the area in 1550 . In 1897 , George Creswick bought the house and the land .
Totley Hall
Totley Hall is generally believed to date back to at least 1623 , as this date is carved over the Tudor arched doorway on the building 's main facade . The carvings bear the characters GN 1623 WM , which seems to mean George Newbould . However the hall was the home of the Barker family , who were the squires of Dore and Totley for many generations . Which also seems to suggest the construction of the hall could have been commissioned by Edward Barker of Dore Hall , the current squire in 1623 . The Barker family left their coat of arms above the fireplace in the main entrance lobby . The hall passed out of the ownership of the Barker family in the late 18th century . The hall was extended by John Dodsley Webster in 1883 and 1894 .
According to maps , fields have existed before this date as well as small buildings which would have been farm buildings .
In 1791 , Andrew Gallimore left the estate to his niece Hannah , wife of the Rev . D'Ewes Coke of Nottinghamshire . Coke died in 1811 , and his son , another D'Ewes Coke , took over the hall and provided money for the construction of the infant school . The family sold the Totley Hall in 1881 to W.K . Marples for £2250 . It is at this period that the hall and the farm became two distinct properties .
William Aldam Milner built the lodge on Totley Hall Lane in 1887 . His son was killed in World War I and as a sign of thanks the saddened community gave land and £2000 to build a new church . All Saints church opened in 1924 . Milner died in 1931 . The hall with 160 acres of land was bought by Sheffield Corporation for £5850 in July 1944 . Until 1999 , Totley Hall was owned by Sheffield Polytechnic which became Sheffield Hallam University in 1991 . Sheffield Hallam University sold the property to developers who converted the hall into luxury apartments .
The Old School House
The Infant School was built in 1821 . The first contingent of pupils were 11 boys and 19 girls as well as one school mistress . Hannal Wild taught there in 1833 ; in 1852 Ann Padley took over and stayed for 20 years .
Totley Grange
Totley Grange was a manor house near Totley 's Cross Scythes pub . It was built in 1875 by Ebenezer Hall . He had bought the land from Mr. Parker who had bought it from George B. Greaves . Thomas Earnshaw , a fish and game dealer lived in the house around the 1890s which gave the house the nickname of Fish Villa .
During the 1939 to 1945 war , some kind of electrical wiring work was carried out in The Grange by local women .
In 1965 , work begun on the construction of Totley Grange Estate . Workmen found well lining stones which from the findings could have held water sufficient to feed flora from large greenhouses and gardens .
Sixty-five houses now lie on the estate of the former house .
Industry
As a rural village the main industry has historically been agriculture , and several farms remain in Totley today . As well as agriculture , the brooks running through the village have been used as a source of power for small industrial operations since at least the 17th century . In particular , several mills have stood on Old Hay Brook , engaged in activities such as lead smelting , corn grinding , blade manufacture and paper rolling .
The only industry still open is the Totley Brick Works on Baslow Road . This plant supplied the bricks for the construction of Totley Tunnel and currently produces heat-resistant bricks from materials mined outside of the area . .

`` `` ( , The Watch on the Rhine ) is a German patriotic anthem . The song 's origins are rooted in the historical French–German enmity , and it was particularly popular in Germany during the Franco-Prussian War and the First World War . The original poem was written by Max Schneckenburger during the Rhine crisis of 1840 , and is generally sung to music written by Karl Wilhelm in 1854 , seven years after Schneckenburger 's death .
Origin
Repeated French efforts to annex the Left Bank of the Rhine began with the devastating wars of King Louis XIV . French forces carried out massive scorched earth campaigns in the German south-west . This policy was fully implemented during the Napoleonic Wars with the creation of the Confederation of the Rhine in 1806–1813 . In the two centuries from the Thirty Years ' War to the final defeat of Napoleon I , the German inhabitants of lands by the Rhine suffered from repeated French invasions .
The defeat and exile of Napoleon gave the Germans some respite , but during the Rhine Crisis of 1840 , French prime minister Adolphe Thiers advanced the claim that the Upper and Middle Rhine River should serve as his country 's `` natural eastern border '' . The member states of the German Confederation feared that France was resuming her annexationist designs .
Nikolaus Becker responded to these events by writing a poem called `` '' in which he swore to defend the Rhine . The Swabian merchant Max Schneckenburger , inspired by the German praise and French opposition this received , then wrote the poem `` '' .
In the poem , with five original stanzas , a `` thunderous call '' is made for all Germans to rush and defend the German Rhine , to ensure that `` no enemy sets his foot on the shore of the Rhine '' ( 4th stanza ) . Two stanzas with a more specific text were added by others later . Unlike the older `` '' which praised a monarch , `` '' and other songs written in this period , such as the `` '' ( the third verse of which is Germany 's current national anthem ) and `` '' ( What is the German 's Fatherland ? ) by Ernst Moritz Arndt , called for Germans to unite , to put aside sectionalism , sectarianism , and the rivalries of the various German kingdoms and principalities , to establish a unified German state and defend Germany 's territorial integrity .
Schneckenburger worked in Restoration Switzerland , and his poem was first set to music in Bern by Swiss organist J. Mendel , and performed by tenor for the Prussian ambassador , von Bunsen . This first version did not become very popular . When Karl Wilhelm , musical director of the city of Krefeld , received the poem in 1854 , he produced a musical setting and performed it with his men 's chorus on 11 June , the day of the silver anniversary of the marriage of Prinz Wilhelm von Preussen , later German Emperor Wilhelm I . This version gained popularity at later events .
Lyrics
The following is the complete text of the original five verses , plus additions .
Usage in Germany
During the Vormärz era and the Revolutions of 1848 , a Rhine romanticism movement arose , stressing the cultural and historical significance of the Rhine Gorge and the German territories on the river 's left bank around the cities of Cologne , Worms , Trier and Speyer .
In response to the Ems Dispatch incident , which occurred in Bad Ems , not far from the Rhine , France initiated the Franco-Prussian War of 1870/71 . When in the aftermath of the subsequent French defeat , the Prussian prime minister Otto von Bismarck achieved the Unification of Germany and the German Empire including Alsace–Lorraine was established , `` '' —beside `` '' —was the unofficial second national anthem . The song became famous , and both the composer and the family of the author were honoured and granted an annual pension by Bismarck .
The song 's lyrics also appear on the 1883 Niederwald monument located just outside Rüdesheim am Rhein high above the river , epitomising the `` guard on the Rhine '' itself .
From World War I through to 1945 , the `` Watch on the Rhine '' was one of the most popular songs in Germany , again rivaling the `` '' as the de facto national anthem . In World War II , the daily Wehrmachtbericht radio report began with the tune , until it was replaced by the fanfare from Liszt 's Les préludes in 1941 . The song 's title was also used as the codename for the German offensive in 1944 known today as the Battle of the Bulge .
However , the scenario envisioned in the song – i.e. , an enemy approaching the Rhine and seeking to cross it , and patriotic German youths mobilizing en masse to defend the river with their lives – never came about in reality . Due to the German Army 's preferred offensive strategy , the fighting in 1870–71 , 1914–1918 and 1940 all took place on French soil , far to the west of the Rhine . The same is true also for the German offensive in the 1944 Battle of the Bulge – which as noted used `` Watch on the Rhine '' as its code name , but actually took place away from the river . In 1945 Operation Plunder resulted in a successful allied crossing of the Rhine .
Today , the lands along the western bank of the Rhine between Switzerland and the Netherlands are mainly part of Germany . The Saarland , Rhineland-Palatinate and North Rhine-Westphalia are German federal states ; Alsace and northern Lorraine are parts of France with a German cultural element to them . The French–German enmity was ended in 1963 with the Élysée Treaty and the implementation of the Franco–German friendship , so that the danger of an invasion that loomed for centuries over both nations no longer exists . Today , the song has only historical significance in Germany and is rarely sung or played .
Stage and film
The song has figured in stage works and films .
The tune is quoted near the end of César Cui 's opera Mademoiselle Fifi ( composed 1902/1903 ) , set in France during the Franco–Prussian War .
In Lewis Milestone 's 1930 film All Quiet on the Western Front , the song is played at the end of the first scene as schoolboys , whipped into a patriotic frenzy by their instructor , abandon their studies and head off to enlist in the military . It is also heard in the background of the 1979 remake version of All Quiet on the Western Front when Paul ( played by Richard Thomas ) is preparing to board the train on his way to the front for the first time .
In Jean Renoir 's 1937 film La Grande Illusion , two songs are juxtaposed in exactly the same way as in Casablanca five years later . In the latter movie , `` '' was sung by German officers , who then were drowned out by exiled French singing La Marseillaise ( which began as the `` War Song for the Army of the Rhine '' , written and composed at the Rhine ) .
The song provides the title for Lillian Hellman 's cautionary pre-World War II play Watch on the Rhine ( 1941 ) and the 1943 movie based on it .
In the first and second part of Rainer Werner Fassbinder 's 1980 epic film adaptation of Alfred Döblin 's Berlin Alexanderplatz ( 1929 ) , Franz Biberkopf starts singing the song ( as in the novel ) .
In John Ringo 's science fiction novel Watch on the Rhine ( 2005 ) , cannibal alien hordes landing in France advance towards Germany , and Germans prepare to block them on the Rhine .
In the parodic science fiction film Iron Sky ( 2012 ) , the Nazis living on the far side of the moon use the song 's tune ( with different lyrics ) as their national anthem .
In François Ozon 's 2016 film Franz , a portion of the song is sung by several German characters in a bar .
Adaptations
The tune for the alma mater of Yale University , `` Bright College Years '' , was taken from Karl Wilhelm 's `` Die Wacht am Rhein '' . New lyrics to the `` splendid tune '' were written by Henry Durand in 1881 .
The tune was used by Hotchkiss School in Lakeville , Connecticut for their hymn `` Fair Hotchkiss '' . The tune is used by Doshisha University for its school song , `` Doshisha College Song '' .
Italian poet Giovanni Pascoli also wrote new , patriotic lyrics to the song 's tune , titled `` La vedetta delle Alpi '' . They speak about a `` guard on the Alps '' ( Alps play the part of the sacred boundaries , just as the Rhein river does in the original lyrics ) . The poem bears the subtitle `` Twin anthem of the 'Wacht am Rhein ' '' .

Louisiana Radio Network ( LRN ) is a state radio network based in Baton Rouge , Louisiana , that produces news , sports , business and agricultural news programming distributed via satellite to 62 affiliates throughout Louisiana and parts of Mississippi . Louisiana Radio Network ( LRN ) is a sponsor of the annual Louisiana Agriculture Hall of Distinction and publishes Tiger Rag Magazine , which focuses on Louisiana State University sports .
Launched in 1974 , the network was acquired in 2010 by Jim Engster , who has been involved with LRN since 1983 .
In August 2012 , LRN merged its agrinews programming with the Louisiana Farm Bureau Radio Network to create the only agriculture network of its kind in Louisiana , the Louisiana Farm Bureau Agrinews Network , and one of the South 's largest agrinews programming networks .
Programming
LRN 's daily broadcast schedule is a mix of live and prerecorded programs that air throughout the day .
LRN provides two news-call programs , each consisting of up to 20 actualities by newsmakers of the day . Affiliates are free to integrate the cuts into locally produced newscasts . LRN news scripts are transmitted to affiliates similar to wire services . The network also offers various news features , which includes the latest business and financial news .
With access to microphones in the Louisiana House of Representatives and the Louisiana State Senate , LRN provides daily coverage of the Louisiana legislature during all regular and special sessions . Ask the Governor is a monthly radio show that offers residents a chance to speak directly to Governor John Bel Edwards on topics they see as important .
History
One of the country 's earliest state radio networks , LRN was launched in 1974 as the Louisiana Network by five investors — Tim Patton , Rhett and Ann McMahon , John Brewer and John Keogh . The network offered live , hourly newscasts via leased broadcast circuits , or dedicated long-distance telephone lines , to 12 charter affiliates . Stations in Ferriday , Oak Grove and Farmerville were among the first affiliates , several of which remain with the network .
After assembling the broadcast and electronic equipment , the McMahons and Brewer constructed a studio and small office . Once the studio was linked to the broadcast circuits leased from South Central Bell , the first LRN newscast aired in October 1974 .
Brewer and Ann McMahon wrote and announced 13 daily newscasts Monday-Friday for the first year . Though the newscasts originally were timed by hand , the network used a control clock synchronized with Greenwich Mean Time to maintain accurate broadcast schedules .
The LRN staff began expanding in 1975 with the hiring of a full-time sales manager and a farm director in 1976 .
Gulf Coast expansion
In 1978 , LRN and the Georgia Network formed Interstate Communications Inc. and launched the Florida Network . Separately , LRN bought the fledgling Mississippi Network ( MN ) in 1980 and moved its operations from the outskirts of Jackson , Mississippi , to a new downtown office and studio space closer to the Mississippi State Capitol , where MN reporters conducted a majority of newsgathering .
College sports
Beginning in the mid-1980s , LRN has at various times offered radio play-by-play broadcasts rights for several Louisiana universities . With the Mississippi Network , LRN was among the country 's first regional radio networks to acquire university sports broadcasting rights . LRN also pioneered the combination of game-day broadcasts with advertising and stadium sales of game-day programs , now common for the industry . LRN held the network rights for LSU sports from 1994-2006 .
In 2000 , LRN acquired Tiger Rag Magazine , which bills itself as “ the Bible of LSU sports . '' The magazine offers game previews and recaps , in-depth interviews and photos . It is known for its extensive LSU football recruiting coverage and insider information .
In 2005 , the magazine 's operations were moved into LRN 's offices . The two companies are based in the Court Plaza Building , located south of downtown Baton Rouge and LSU .
In 2016 , the magazine launched Tiger Rag Extra in addition to its main publication . Tiger Rag Extra covers recruiting and game analysis , along with the food , fashion and passion of LSU sports .
In 2019 , Tiger Rag launched Tiger Rag TV , an hour long , in-depth look at LSU sports . The weekly show features recognized sports guests and coaches from throughout Louisiana , with emphasis on fans , tailgating , and the rich history of LSU sports . Engster serves as one of the program 's hosts , along with Tiger Rag editor Ron Higgins , associate editor Tyler Nunez and Louisiana Radio Network news and sports director Jeff Palermo and WAFB-TV weekend reporter Chelsea Leblanc . The show airs on Wednesdays at 7 p.m. on Cox Sports ( CST ) .
Technology upgrades
In 1983 , LRN became one of the first regional radio networks to move from leased broadcast circuits to satellite transmission . The network refined a system that used a much smaller portion of a single satellite transponder . The new method lowered costs and allowed LRN to sublease its satellite equipment to other companies that still use it for their own communications . Uplink facilities were built in Jackson , Miss. , and in Baton Rouge to transmit programming from both networks . By 1985 , LRN installed more than 150 downlinks to affiliates in both states .
Consolidation , ownership change
LRN began consolidating operations in the mid-1980s , selling its stake in the Florida Network to the Georgia Network . It also sold the Mississippi Network and the associated college-sports contracts . The company name was returned to Louisiana Network Inc .
In April 2010 , Jim Engster , a long-time Baton Rouge journalist and radio talk-show host , bought a controlling interest in the network after getting final approval from the Federal Communications Commission . Engster is now owner and president of Louisiana Radio Network .
Engster worked for the network as a reporter , news director and talk-show host from 1983-1998 . He returned in 2006 as general manager . Engster hosts `` Talk Louisiana '' which airs Monday-Friday from 9-10 a.m. on WRKF-FM , National Public Radio .

Halloweentown is a 1998 Disney Channel Original Movie directed by Duwayne Dunham . The first installment in Halloweentown series starring Debbie Reynolds , Kimberly J . Brown , Joey Zimmerman , and Judith Hoag . It is the fourth Disney Channel Original Movie . It centers on Marnie , who on her 13th birthday , learns she 's a witch , discovers a secret portal , and is transported to Halloweentown—a magical place where ghosts and ghouls , witches and werewolves live apart from the human world : but she soon finds herself battling wicked warlocks , evil curses , and endless surprises .
Plot
The film opens with Marnie Piper and her mother , Gwen , arguing over why she and her younger siblings Dylan and Sophie can not go out for Halloween . Marnie can not go to a friend 's costume party , and her mother offers no clear explanation . Gwen 's mother Agatha , or `` Aggie '' shows up for her annual Halloween visit . The children are happier to see Aggie than Gwen is , as Aggie openly encourages the children to get more involved in Halloween . Aggie and Gwen are secretly witches , but Gwen is determined to live a normal life as a mortal instead .
Despite objections from Gwen , Aggie is intent on training Marnie as a witch . Before heading home , Aggie reads the children a bedtime story called `` Halloweentown '' , about a mystical place where witches , vampires and monsters of all sorts live in peace . Sophie points out a drawing of a witch in the book that resembles Marnie ; Aggie does nothing to stop Marnie from imagining such a thing . After putting the children to bed , Gwen and Aggie get into an argument , with Marnie , who has sneaked downstairs , eavesdropping . Gwen is angry that her mother encourages the children to enjoy Halloween , and insists Marnie will be raised as a mortal , like her father was , and not a witch . Aggie does n't understand why Gwen wants to live without magic , and wants to train Marnie before she turns 13 , as at this point without training , she would lose her powers . Aggie then asks Gwen for help . Citizens of Halloweentown have been disappearing , and while Gwen does n't take this seriously and says it is possible that the missing have simply moved , Aggie believes that foul play is involved .
When Aggie leaves to return home , Marnie and Dylan covertly follow her . They see Aggie getting onto a magical bus , and sneak onto it through the back door . When they arrive in Halloweentown , Aggie does not see Marnie and Dylan getting off the bus , and the children lose sight of her . At the same time , Marnie and Dylan realize that Sophie has sneaked onto the bus with them . They begin looking for Aggie , and are approached by Kalabar , the mayor of Halloweentown . He whistles for a cab driven by Benny , a skeleton with a bad sense of humor . The children find their grandmother 's mansion , and against her better judgment , Aggie decides not to take them back to their home immediately . She says she will start Marnie 's witch training , but has to take care of `` the bad thing '' first . She shows her grandchildren what she is talking about : in her cauldron , a vision of a hooded figure appears , laughing maniacally . She says she must activate Merlin 's talisman with a spell and potion to defeat the evil creature .
After trying , and failing , to light the talisman with `` instant '' potion , Aggie takes the children back to town to shop for the right ingredients . The family is introduced to Luke , a goblin who was made handsome by a `` shadow creature '' . He makes a clumsy pass at Marnie , which she turns down on the spot . Gwen , who had noticed her children were missing and immediately blamed Aggie , arrives in Halloweentown to retrieve them , much to Marnie 's objections . Gwen tells the children to say goodbye to Aggie , then takes them to the bus station , but can not find another bus back to the mortal world according to a two-headed ticket vendor , whose two heads are constantly arguing with each other , and decides to see if the mayor can do anything to help . She is shocked to see that the mayor is Kalabar , an ex-boyfriend of hers . After Kalabar briefly leaves to handle another problem , Gwen and her children see Aggie walking somewhere with Luke . Sensing Aggie might be in trouble , they follow Luke and her to an abandoned movie theater .
Aggie meets the hooded demon in the theater , where the missing Halloweentown citizens have been frozen in time . Aggie declines to give the talisman to the demon . Gwen and the children enter the theater as Luke rushes out in fear . The demon freezes Gwen and Aggie . The children escape , and obtain the necessary ingredientsthe hair of a werewolf , the sweat of a ghost , and a vampire 's fangto make the potion that will activate the talisman . They then realize they must place the talisman in the large jack-o'-lantern in the center of the town to defeat the demon .
When they arrive to install it , the demon suddenly appears and reveals himself to be Kalabar , who is bitter that Gwen ( whom he used to date when she was a teenager ) chose to marry a human instead of him . He starts talking to the townspeople and tries to persuade them to join him and take over the mortal world . With the help of Luke , Marnie slips past Kalabar long enough to climb up onto the jack-o'-lantern and try to place the talisman inside . Kalabar , noticing this , casts a spell to freeze her . As she is about to pass out , Marnie drops the talisman inside the jack-o'-lantern , which causes it to illuminate . This unfreezes her and everyone trapped inside the theater , and severely weakens Kalabar . Kalabar obtains the talisman and says he will use it to become the ruler of both the mortal and magical world . Dylan is revealed to have magic powers and eventually joins Gwen , Aggie , and his sisters in confronting Kalabar and using their combined powers to defeat him . Luke is restored to his goblin appearance .
The film ends with the family getting on the bus and blasting off to the mortal world . Gwen and Aggie decide to train Marnie as a witch and Aggie decides to stay in the mortal world to spend more time with her grandchildren .

Production
Development
Steve White , in the 1970s and 1980s used to be the head of NBC 's 'Movie and Mini-Series ' department . In 1986 he left the company to establish his own production company , Steve White Entertainment .
The Wonderful World of Disney which had been airing on NBC since 1988 , was a sought-after property that ABC wanted to return to the network . NBC agreed to transfer the show to ABC on the condition that Walt Disney Television produce six-movies for their network in return . In 1991 , Sheri Singer the `` Senior Vice-President of TV Movies '' for Walt Disney Television was to collaborate with Steve White on up to three movies to fulfil the contract with NBC .
In 1993 , Steve and Sheri married . Towards the end of Sheri 's time as an executive for Disney , Steve came up to her one day and said , `` I do n't know where to go with this but my daughter said to me , 'Dad , where do all the creatures from Halloween go the rest of the year when its not October 31 ? ' '' Dubbed Halloweentown the concept was pitched to NBC as part of the six-movie deal , and the network bought it . With the green-light , Singer and White approached screenwriter Paul Bernbaum to write the script . Bernbaum took inspiration from his own life , and used the names of his children , Marnie , Dylan , and Sophie as the protagonists . Since the movie was to air in the 9pm timeslot , the film was geared towards an adult demographic . As a result original script was much darker and mature . In 1994 , the script was presented to NBC , and the network decided to pass on the project . Singer ended up leaving the Walt Disney Company at the end of January 1994 .
In 1997 , Singer and White established , Singer/White Entertainment , and returned to the idea of Halloweentown . The duo pitched it to Disney Channel who initially passed on the project as well . The executives at the network changed their mind after they aired Under Wraps , which was well received . The network returned to Singer/White Entertainment and the film was redeveloped into more of a children 's film .
In a 2018 interview with Insider , director Duwayne Dunham revealed the film was presented to him as a , `` $ 20 million to $ 30 million project '' — but the budget ended up only being $ 4 million .
Casting
After receiving the go ahead from Disney Channel , Singer/White Entertainment began casting . The first person cast for the film was Debbie Reynolds , who at the time had just decided to venture into television work . A list of actors were purposed to Singer/White , and Sheri Singer said , `` When we saw the list , we took one look at her name and said , oh my god , would she really do it ? This is absolutely unbelievably blessed and terrific idea for casting ... We never went to anyone else . ''
In September 2016 , Kimberly J . Brown recalled her audition for the film which she had to react to the conversation where it 's revealed the character Marnie is a witch . Brown read for the role twice before being cast .
In a 2020 Galaxy Con question-and answer panel , Judith Hoag revealed she had a meeting with the head of Disney Television where she read for the part . Hoag , who had previously played April O'Neil said `` I kind of knew in the room that I had gotten the job because his son was a die-hard Ninja Turtle fan . ''
According to Singer , the hardest role to cast was that of antagonist Kalabar , `` ... he had to be scary-but-Disney-Channel-scary . '' Robin Thomas , who had previously worked with White on Amityville Dollhouse was brought in to audition , and was the final choice .
Pre-production
After Kimberly J . Brown was cast as Marnie , artists used a photo of her to create the `` Halloweentown '' book prop . The image of the witch flying across the page needed to resemble the actress .
The initial ending of the film featured Marnie traveling deep into an enchanted forest to place the talisman . With each step the character was supposed to grow older the deeper into the forest she went , the make-up department took a life-mask of Kimberly J . Brown to make the different prosthetics to age Marnie . Before the make-up process was completed , the ending was rewritten to the character placing the talisman in the Jack-o'-lantern .
Filming
Halloweentown was filmed in St. Helens , Oregon , and Scappoose , Oregon from May to June 1998 , across 24-days . The 'Nob Hill Riverview ' bed and breakfast in Saint Helens was used for exterior shots of Aggie Cromwell 's Halloweentown home . The voice of the skeleton Benny was added in post-production , as a result the actors on set were performing opposite a voice-less animatronic .
While filming a dance scene in the theater Debbie Reynolds pulled a muscle , Singer recalled Reynolds saying , `` You know what , I 've been doing this for years and years . I 've danced with pulled muscles and pain and I 'm not going to hold [ production ] up . '' Singer went on to say how impressive it was for the young actors on set to see what `` real work ethic '' was .
The final scene shot was of Marnie and Aggie flying . Filming took a whole day , and used the actors against a blue-screen .
Reception
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 80 % based on reviews from 5 critics .
Complex magazine put Halloweentown as number nine on its `` The 40 Best Disney Channel Original Movies '' list . Katie Heaney for BuzzFeed called the first three movies one of the best things about Halloween .
Sequels
Halloweentown was followed by three sequels : Halloweentown II : Kalabar 's Revenge in 2001 , Halloweentown High in 2004 , and Return to Halloweentown in 2006 .

The Ancient Egyptians called the Mediterranean Wadj-wr/Wadj-Wer/Wadj-Ur . This term ( ) was the name given by the Ancient Egyptians to the semi-solid , semi-aquatic region characterized by papyrus forests to the north of the cultivated Nile Delta , and , by extension , the sea beyond .
The Ancient Greeks called the Mediterranean simply ( ; 'the Sea ' ) or sometimes ( ; 'the Great Sea ' ) , ( ; 'Our Sea ' ) , or ( ; 'the sea around us ' ) .
The Romans called it ( 'Great Sea ' ) or ( 'Internal Sea ' ) and , starting with the Roman Empire , ( 'Our Sea ' ) . The term appears later : Solinus apparently used this in the 3rd century , but the earliest extant witness to it is in the 6th century , in Isidore of Seville . It means 'in the middle of land , inland ' in Latin , a compound of ( 'middle ' ) , ( 'land , earth ' ) , and ( 'having the nature of ' ) .
The Latin word is a calque of Greek ( ; 'inland ' ) , from ( , 'in the middle ' ) and ( , 'of the earth ' ) , from ( , 'land , earth ' ) . The original meaning may have been 'the sea in the middle of the earth ' , rather than 'the sea enclosed by land ' .
Ancient Iranians called it the `` Roman Sea '' , in Classic Persian texts was called ( ) which may be from Middle Persian form , ( ) .
The Carthaginians called it the `` Syrian Sea '' . In ancient Syriac texts , Phoenician epics and in the Hebrew Bible , it was primarily known as the `` Great Sea '' , , , ( Numbers ; Book of Joshua ; Ezekiel ) or simply as `` The Sea '' ( 1 Kings ) . However , it has also been called the `` Hinder Sea '' because of its location on the west coast of Greater Syria or the Holy Land ( and therefore behind a person facing the east ) , which is sometimes translated as `` Western Sea '' . Another name was the `` Sea of the Philistines '' , ( Book of Exodus ) , from the people inhabiting a large portion of its shores near the Israelites . In Modern Hebrew , it is called , 'the Middle Sea ' . In Classic Persian texts was called ) `` The Western Sea '' or `` Syrian Sea '' .
In Modern Arabic , it is known as ( ) 'the [ White ] Middle Sea ' . In Islamic and older Arabic literature , it was ( or ) 'the Sea of the Romans ' or 'the Roman Sea ' . At first , that name referred to only the Eastern Mediterranean , but it was later extended to the whole Mediterranean . Other Arabic names were ( ) ( `` the Sea of Syria '' ) and ( ) ( `` the Sea of the West '' ) .
In Turkish , it is the 'the White Sea ' ; in Ottoman , , which sometimes means only the Aegean Sea . The origin of the name is not clear , as it is not known in earlier Greek , Byzantine or Islamic sources . It may be to contrast with the Black Sea . In Persian , the name was translated as , which was also used in later Ottoman Turkish . It is probably the origin of the colloquial Greek phrase ( , lit . `` White Sea '' ) .
According to Johann Knobloch , in classical antiquity , cultures in the Levant used colours to refer to the cardinal points : black referred to the north ( explaining the name Black Sea ) , yellow or blue to east , red to south ( e.g. , the Red Sea ) , and white to west . This would explain the Greek , the Bulgarian
, the Turkish , and the Arab nomenclature described above , `` White Sea '' .
In marathi language from maharashtra state of india its called as bhumadhya samudra ( भुमध्य समुद्र ) literally meaning sea enclosed by land .
It is known colloquially by United States Navy sailors , making regular six month deployments to the area , as `` The Med '' .

User experience evaluation ( UXE ) or user experience assessment ( UXA ) refers to a collection of methods , skills and tools utilized to uncover how a person perceives a system ( product , service , non-commercial item , or a combination of them ) before , during and after interacting with it . It is non-trivial to assess user experience since user experience is subjective , context-dependent and dynamic over time . For a UXA study to be successful , the researcher has to select the right dimensions , constructs , and methods and target the research for the specific area of interest such as game , transportation , mobile , etc .
Dimensions
There are many different dimensions to consider when choosing the best assessment approach :
Goal : Summative ( on the final product ) or formative ( during the process )
Approach : Objective or subjective
Data : Quantitative or qualitative
Granularity : Momentary , episodic , or overall UX
Setup : Lab or field
Laboratory experiments may work well for studying a specific aspect of user experience , but holistic user experience is optimally studied over a longer period of time with real users in a natural environment .
Constructs
In all cases , however , there are certain aspects of user experience that researchers are interested in ( measures ) , and certain procedures and techniques used for collecting the data ( methods ) . There are many measures and some high-level constructs of user experience that can be used as the basis for defining the user experience measures , for example :
Utility : Does the user perceive the functions in the system as useful and fit for the purpose ?
Usability : Does the user feel that it is easy and efficient to get things done with the system ?
Aesthetics : Does the user see the system as visually attractive ? Does it feel pleasurable in hand ?
Identification : Can I identify myself with the product ? Do I look good when using it ?
Stimulation : Does the system give me inspiration ? Or wow experiences ?
Value : Is the system important to me ? What is its value for me ?
To properly evaluate user experience , metrics and other factors surrounding a study need to be taken into account , for example :
Data ( metrics ) : The time taken to complete a task .
Scale ( metrics ) : Indicators that show effectiveness , efficiency and satisfaction .
Other Factors : Conditions of use , the surrounding environment and other human factors .
Methods
An individual method can collect data about a set of specific constructs of user experience . For instance , usability testing is used to collect data about usability construct . Methods also differ if they are to measure a momentary or episodic experience ( i.e. , assessing how a person feels about a specific interaction episode or after executing a task ) or an experience over time , also known as an longitudinal experience . UXA methods can be classified in three categories : implicit , explicit and creative methods .
Implicit methods
Implicit methods of UX research focus not just only on what the users say , but also on what the user can not express verbally . Many available tools can assist in the implicit evaluation , in particular to gather implicit or objective data . When available , UX researchers utilize state of the art equipment to uncover all aspects of the experience .
Examples of implicit evaluation methods and tools :
Eye tracking
Attention tracking
User tracking
Task and reaction measurement , galvanic skin response or skin conductance
Electroencephalography ( EEG )
Observation studies : participant observation where observers monitor the participant 's reactions such as facial and other gestures , the tone of voice or other body language cues
Explicit methods
Explicit methods of UX research explore what the user is consciously aware of getting them to reflect on their own feelings or thoughts , and gather their views and opinions . An important aspect of explicit methods includes usability testing and emotion evaluation .
Emotion assessment
When investigating momentary user experiences , we can evaluate the level of positive affect , negative affect , joy , surprise , frustration , etc . The measures for emotions are bound to the methods used for emotion assessment , but typical emotion measures are e.g . valence and arousal . Objective emotion data can be collected by psychophysiological measurements or by observing expressed emotions . Subjective emotional data can be collected by using self-report methods , which can be verbal or non-verbal .
Examples of emotion assessment methods :
Psychophysiological emotion measurements aim to identify emotions from physiological changes in muscles ( e.g . face ) , pupils , skin , heart , brains , etc .
Expression
Think aloud protocol can be used for reporting emotions ( real-time verbal self-report )
Positive and Negative Affect Schedule ( PANAS ) ( retrospective verbal self-report )
Geneva emotion wheel ( retrospective verbal self-report )
Photographic Affect Meter ( PAM )
Emotion slider ( continuous non-verbal self-report )
Sensual evaluation instrument ( SEI ) ( snapshot non-verbal self-report )
PrEmo , a new version of EmoCards for assessing emotion ( snapshot non-verbal self-report )
Creative methods
Equally important to implicit and explicit methods are the creative methods that the user researcher can utilize in order to bring together the design team 's view , as well as the target market 's dreams , aspirations and ideas of optimal design . These activities are more open and allow people to either co-create with the engineers/designers , or to use their imagination to express their ideal system .
Examples of creative assessment methods
Co-design activities
Creativity workshops
Paper prototyping , wireframing , mind mapping
Card sorting
Personas
Longitudinal
In contrast to identifying a momentary emotion , longitudinal UXA investigates how a person feels about a system as a whole , after using it for a while .
Examples of longitudinal UXA methods ( excluding traditional usability methods ) :
Diary methods for self-reporting experiences during field studies
Experience sampling method ( ESM ) for self-reporting during field studies
Day reconstruction method ( DRM ) – story-telling to reveal the meaningful experiences during field studies
AttrakDiff questionnaire for overall UX evaluation
User experience questionnaire ( UEQ ) ( available in several language versions )
Ladder interviews – e.g . to find out attitudes or values behind behaviour or experience
Holistic user experience ( HUX ) identifying the relevant product factors for holistic user experience
Areas of UXA research
Transportation
Automobiles have come a long way since their beginning in the late 19th century . One of the major things that have helped automobiles to provide more safety and convenience is electronics . With the advances in technology and electronics , car manufacturers have been able to offer a wide variety of services and conveniences . From the creation of the electronic fuel injection to the popular global positioning system found standard in many cars today , the auto industry has revolutionized the way people travel from place to place . Understanding how people interact with vehicles today , what contributes to a great driving experience , what is their current relationship with the car , what placement does it have in their lives , is key to the development of these technologies . This information ensures user-centered design practices to generate cohesive , predictive and desirable designs .
Once specific design concepts and ideas are on the table , UXA researchers further explore how people react to them regarding desirability , findability , usefulness , credibility , accessibility , usability and human factors metrics . Outcomes of this work includes user requirements , concept validation , and design guidelines . Researchers have conducted intriguing research to answer questions such as : could an In-Vehicle Infotainment ( IVI ) system with a speech evoked personality change your relationship with your car ? , could an in-car system support unwinding after work ? , could in-car solutions address the special needs of children as passengers , and assist the parents with the task of driving ? and many others . Additionally , workshops and gatherings of researchers around the world take place to discuss current evaluation techniques and advance the field of experience research in the area of transportation . An important professional venue for this work is AutomotiveUI , the International Conference on Automotive User Interfaces and Interactive Vehicular Applications .
UXA methods for transportation
As with other UXA 's the method chosen has a lot to do with the outcome desired and where the project is in its design cycle . Given that , methods are selected best suited to the research problem which most times ends up being a combination of implicit , explicit and creative . Some methods include :
Interviews : both structured and un-structured .
Diary studies
Workload assessment questionnaires ( i.e . DALI –Driving Activity Load Index adapted from NASA-TLX )
Subjective assessment of interfaces questionnaires ( i.e . SASSI—Subjective Assessment of Speech System Interfaces ) that can lead to design guidelines to speech interfaces
Experience Probing ( Prototypes , storytelling , storyboards )
Co-design activities
Observations ( i.e . coding for frustration , delight and other non-verbal cues )
Video games
A relatively new pursuit in video game play-testing is UX and usability research . An increasing number of companies including some of the world 's biggest publishers have begun outsourcing UX evaluation or opening their own in-house labs . Researchers use a variety of HCI and psychological techniques to examine the effectiveness of the user experience of the games during the design process .
There are also some companies starting to use biometrics to measure the relationship between in-game events and the player 's emotions and feelings ( the UX ) , such as Player Research and Serco ExperienceLab in the UK , and Valve , Electronic Arts , BoltPeters , and VMC Labs in the US and Canada . The interest in this area comes from both academia and industry , sometimes enabling collaborative work . Game UX work has been featured at professional venues , such as the Game Developers Conference ( GDC ) .
Web design
User experience evaluation has become common practice in web design , especially within organizations implementing user-centered design practices . Through user testing , the user experience is constantly evaluated throughout the whole product design life-cycle .

In ancient Roman religion and mythology , Tellus Mater or Terra Mater ( `` Mother Earth '' ) is the personification of the Earth . Although Tellus and Terra are hardly distinguishable during the Imperial era , Tellus was the name of the original earth goddess in the religious practices of the Republic or earlier . The scholar Varro ( 1st century BC ) lists Tellus as one of the di selecti , the twenty principal gods of Rome , and one of the twelve agricultural deities . She is regularly associated with Ceres in rituals pertaining to the earth and agricultural fertility .
The attributes of Tellus were the cornucopia , bunches of flowers , or fruit . She was typically depicted reclining , or rising , waist high , from a hole in the ground . Her male complement was a sky god such as Caelus ( Uranus ) or a form of Jupiter . Her Greek counterpart is Gaia , and among the Etruscans her name was Cel . Michael Lipka has argued that the Terra Mater who appears during the reign of Augustus is a direct transfer of the Greek Ge Mater into Roman religious practice , while Tellus , whose ancient temple was within Rome 's sacred boundary ( pomerium ) , represents the original earth goddess cultivated by the state priests .
Name
The two words terra and tellus are thought to derive from the formulaic phrase tersa tellus , meaning `` dry land '' . The etymology of tellus is uncertain ; it is perhaps related to Sanskrit talam , `` plain ground '' .
The 4th century AD Latin commentator Servius distinguishes between use of tellus and terra . Terra , he says , is properly used of the elementum , earth as one of the four classical elements with air ( Ventus ) , water ( Aqua ) , and fire ( Ignis ) . Tellus is the goddess , whose name can be substituted ( ponimus ... pro ) for her functional sphere the earth , just as the name Vulcanus is used for fire , Ceres for produce , and Liber for wine . Tellus thus refers to the guardian deity of Earth and by extension the globe itself . Tellus may be an aspect of the spirit called Dea Dia by the Arval priests , or at least a close collaborator with her as `` divinity of the clear sky . ''
Varro identifies Terra Mater with Ceres :
Not without cause was the Earth ( Terra ) called Mater and Ceres . It was believed that those who cultivated her led a pious and useful life ( piam et utilem ... vitam ) , and that they were the sole survivors from the line of King Saturn .
Ovid distinguishes between Tellus as the locus ( `` site , location '' ) of growth , and Ceres as its causa ( `` cause , agent '' ) . Mater , the Latin word for `` mother , '' is often used as an honorific for goddesses , including Vesta , who was represented as a virgin . `` Mother '' therefore is an honorific that expresses the respect one would owe any good mother . Tellus and Terra are both regarded as mothers in both the literal and honorific sense ; Vesta in the honorific only .
Temple
The Temple of Tellus was the most prominent landmark of the Carinae , a fashionable neighborhood on the Oppian Hill . It was near homes ( domūs ) belonging to Pompey and to the Cicero family .
The temple was the result of a votum made in 268 BC by Publius Sempronius Sophus when an earthquake struck during a battle with the Picenes . Others say it was built by the Roman people . It occupied the former site of a house belonging to Spurius Cassius , which had been torn down when he was executed in 485 BC for attempting to make himself king . The temple constructed by Sophus more than two centuries later was most likely a rebuilding of the people 's . The anniversary ( dies natalis ) of its dedication was December 13 .
A mysterious object called the magmentarium was stored in the temple , which was also known for a representation of Italy on the wall , either a map or an allegory .
A statue of Quintus Cicero , set up by his brother Marcus , was among those that stood on the temple grounds . Cicero claims that the proximity of his property caused some Romans to assume he had a responsibility to help maintain the temple .
Festivals
Festivals celebrated for Tellus were mainly concerned with agriculture and often connected with Ceres . In January , both goddesses were honored as `` mothers of produce '' at the moveable feast ( feriae conceptivae ) of Sementivae , a festival of sowing . On December 13 , the anniversary of the Temple of Tellus was celebrated along with a lectisternium ( banquet ) for Ceres , who embodied `` growing power '' and the productivity of the earth .
Tellus received the sacrifice of a pregnant cow at the Fordicidia , a festival pertaining to fertility and animal husbandry held April 15 , in the middle of the Cerialia ( April 12–19 ) . Festivals for deities of vegetation and the earth cluster in April on the Roman calendar . The institution of the Fordicidia was attributed to Numa Pompilius , the Sabine second king of Rome . During a time when Rome was struggling with harsh agricultural conditions , Numa was instructed by the rustic god Faunus in a dream that a sacrifice to Tellus was needed . As is often the case with oracles , the message required interpretation :
`` By the death of cattle , oh King , Tellus must be placated : two cows , that is . Let a single heifer yield two lives ( animae ) for the rites . '' Numa solved the riddle by instituting the sacrifice of a pregnant cow . The purpose of the sacrifice , as suggested by the Augustan poet Ovid and by the 6th-century antiquarian John Lydus , was to assure the fertility of the planted grain already growing in the womb of Mother Earth in the guise of Tellus . This public sacrifice was conducted in the form of a holocaust on behalf of the state at the Capitol , and also by each of the thirty curiae , the most ancient divisions of the city made by Romulus from the original three tribes . The state sacrifice was presided over by the Vestals , who used the ash from the holocaust to prepare suffimen , a ritual substance used later in April for the Parilia .
During the Secular Games held by Augustus in 17 BC , Terra Mater was among the deities honored in the Tarentum in the Campus Martius . Her ceremonies were conducted by `` Greek rite '' ( ritus graecus ) , distinguishing her from the Roman Tellus whose temple was within the pomerium . She received the holocaust of a pregnant sow . The Secular Games of 249 BC had been dedicated to the underworld deities Dis pater and Proserpina , whose underground altar was in the Tarentum . Under Augustus , the Games ( ludi ) were dedicated to seven other deities , invoked as the Moerae , Iuppiter , Ilithyia , Iuno , Terra Mater , Apollo and Diana .
Prayers and rituals
The sacrum ceriale ( `` cereal rite '' ) was carried out for Tellus and Ceres by a flamen , probably the Flamen Cerialis , who also invoked twelve male helper gods . According to Varro , the two goddesses jointly received the porca praecidanea , a pig sacrificed in advance of the harvest . Some rites originally pertaining to Tellus may have been transferred to Ceres , or shared with her , as a result of her identification with Greek Demeter .
Tellus was felt to be present during rites of passage , either implicitly , or invoked . She was perhaps involved in the ceremonies attending the birth of a child , as the newborn was placed on the ground immediately after coming into the world . Tellus was also invoked at Roman weddings .
Dedicatory inscriptions to either Tellus or Terra are relatively few , but epitaphs during the Imperial period sometimes contain formulaic expressions such as `` Terra Mater , receive me . '' In the provincial mining area of Pannonia , at present-day Ljubija , votive inscriptions record dedications to Terra Mater from vilici , imperial slave overseers who ran operations at ore smelting factories ( ferrariae ) .
These are all dated April 21 , when the founding day ( dies natalis , `` birthday '' ) of Rome was celebrated , perhaps reflecting the connection between the Parilia on April 21 and the Fordicidia as a feast of Tellus . The emperor Septimius Severus restored a temple of Terra Mater at Rudnik , a silver mining area of Moesia Superior . Measuring 30 by 20 meters , the temple was located at the entrance to the work zone .
Iconography
Tellus is often identified as the central figure on the so-called Italia relief panel of the Ara Pacis , which is framed by bucrania ( ornamental ox heads ) and motifs of vegetative and animal fertility and abundance . Terra long remained common as a personification , if not exactly treated as a goddess . She often formed part of sets of the personified Four Elements , typically identified by a cornucopia , farm animals , and vegetable products .
Tellumo
Male counterparts named Tellumo or Tellurus are mentioned , although rarely . Augustine of Hippo identified Tellumo as the male counterpart of Tellus . A Tellurus is named by Capella but by no other source .
In science
In several modern Romance languages , Terra or Terre is the name of planet Earth . Earth is sometimes referred to as `` Terra '' by speakers of English to match post-classical Latin astronomical naming conventions , and to distinguish the planet from the soil covering part of it . It is also , rarely , called `` Tellus '' , mainly via the adjective `` tellurian '' .

The 4721st Air Defense Group is a discontinued group of the United States Air Force . Its last assignment was with the 4700th Air Defense Wing at Larson Air Force Base , Washington , where it was last active in 1959 .
The group was formed to provide a single command and support organization for the two fighter interceptor squadrons of Air Defense Command ( ADC ) , that were tenants at Larson , a Tactical Air Command ( TAC ) base . It was discontinued after the 322d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron moved in 1959 , leaving only a single fighter squadron at Larson .
History
The 4721st Air Defense Group was organized in December 1956 at Larson Air Force Base , Washington to centralize supervision and support of the 322d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron ( FIS ) and the 538th FIS . Both squadrons were already stationed at Larson , flying radar equipped and Mighty Mouse rocket armed North American F-86D Sabre interceptor aircraft , and assigned directly to the 9th Air Division . The 4721st was a tenant of Tactical Air Command ( TAC ) 's 62d Air Base Group ( ABG ) , the host organization at Larson .
In July 1957 , the base transferred from TAC to Military Air Transport Service , although the 62d ABG remained the host unit . In the summer of 1957 , both the 322d FIS and the 538th FIS upgraded to later model Sabres equipped with data link to tie them directly into the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment command and control system . About June 1958 , the 538th FIS converted to Lockheed F-104 Starfighters , armed with the M61 Vulcan 20mm rotary cannon and AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles .
In April 1959 , the 322nd FIS moved to Kingsley Field , Oregon and was reassigned out of the group as part of ADC 's drawdown at Larson . The following month , the 4721st was discontinued and its remaining squadron , the 538th FIS , was assigned directly to the 4700th Air Defense Wing .

The Volkswagen C Coupe GTE is a concept automobile first shown in April 2015 at Auto Shanghai . The four-door saloon is a plug-in hybrid , powered by a 2.0L turbocharged gasoline engine coupled with an electric motor , and was intended to preview an upcoming car for the Chinese market , positioned between the Passat and the Phaeton models . An updated version of the C Coupe GTE has been produced by SAIC Volkswagen and sold exclusively in China as the Phideon starting in July 2016 .
Design
Klaus Bischoff , head of design for Volkswagen , stated the C Coupe GTE `` very clearly shows the new 'face ' of top Volkswagen sedans for the first time '' with themes that would be used for future Volkswagen premium sedans , including sharp edges and horizontal lines to emphasize the car 's length and width . Walter de Silva added `` The new rear-end design that is oriented to the classic two-door 'coupé ' has given [ sedans ] more personality . The Volkswagen designers have integrated this stylistic element into the very dynamic design of the C Coupé GTE saloon ; they have developed a striking front end and given the vehicle its own authentic character . They have created a model that appeals to Chinese customers , who always follow the trends of European car design with great interest . ''
The concept C Coupe GTE was painted gold in a finish named `` Golden Atmosphere '' as a nod to its intended Chinese market ; there were no plans to market the car in Europe or America .
Performance
According to Volkswagen , the drivetrain of the C Coupe GTE has a combined output of and from its 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 engine , rated at and alone , coupled to an electric motor rated at and alone . The lithium-ion battery has a capacity of 14.1 kW-hr , and the car is capable of traveling up to on battery power alone at speeds limited to or less . The drivetrain is largely identical to the Audi A6L e-tron .
Fuel consumption is rated at , according to New European Driving Cycle methodology .
Production
The Volkswagen Phideon was introduced at Geneva in March 2016 , and went on sale in China later that year , using conventional ( gasoline-only ) powertrains , although a plug-in hybrid variant was anticipated . The styling and dimensions of the Phideon closely followed the C Coupe GTE .

In the nineteenth edition , two lectures were added to the second chapter . The Persian title of the book , , was renamed to Spiritual Freedom ( ) after several editions by the publisher . It has been reprinted more than 80 times in Iran .
Chapters
The book has eight chapters :
Spiritual Freedom ( ) – two lectures delivered in 1969 in Hosseiniyeh Ershad , Tehran .
Worship and Prayer ( ) – four lectures delivered in 1970 in Hosseiniyeh Ershad , Tehran .
Repentance ( ) – two lectures delivered in 1970 in Hosseiniyeh Ershad , Tehran .
Migration and Jihad ( ) – three lectures delivered in 1971 in Naarmak Mosque , Tehran .
Nobility and Magnanimity of Spirit ( ) – a lecture delivered on November 8 , 1970 , in Hosseiniyeh Ershad , Tehran .
Belief in the Unseen ( ) – a lecture delivered in November 1968 in a private home .
The Criteria for Humanity ( ) – a university lecture .
The School of Humanity ( ) – a lecture delivered at the College of Engineering , University of Tehran .
Reception

The Brownian motion models for financial markets are based on the work of Robert C. Merton and Paul A. Samuelson , as extensions to the one-period market models of Harold Markowitz and William F. Sharpe , and are concerned with defining the concepts of financial assets and markets , portfolios , gains and wealth in terms of continuous-time stochastic processes .
Under this model , these assets have continuous prices evolving continuously in time and are driven by Brownian motion processes . This model requires an assumption of perfectly divisible assets and a frictionless market ( i.e . that no transaction costs occur either for buying or selling ) . Another assumption is that asset prices have no jumps , that is there are no surprises in the market . This last assumption is removed in jump diffusion models .
Financial market processes
Consider a financial market consisting of financial assets , where one of these assets , called a bond or money market , is risk free while the remaining assets , called stocks , are risky .
Definition
A financial market is defined as that satisfies the following :
A probability space .
A time interval .
A -dimensional Brownian process where adapted to the augmented filtration .
A measurable risk-free money market rate process .
A measurable mean rate of return process .
A measurable dividend rate of return process .
A measurable volatility process , such that .
A measurable , finite variation , singularly continuous stochastic .
The initial conditions given by .
The augmented filtration
Let be a probability space , and a
be
D-dimensional Brownian motion stochastic process , with the natural filtration :
If are the measure 0 ( i.e . null under
measure ) subsets of , then define
the augmented filtration :
The difference between and is that the
latter is both left-continuous , in the sense that :
and right-continuous , such that :
while the former is only left-continuous .
Bond
A share of a bond ( money market ) has price at time
with , is continuous , adapted , and has finite variation . Because it has finite variation , it can be decomposed into an absolutely continuous part and a singularly continuous part , by Lebesgue 's decomposition theorem . Define :
and
resulting in the SDE :
which gives :
Thus , it can be easily seen that if is absolutely continuous ( i.e . ) , then the price of the bond evolves like the value of a risk-free savings account with instantaneous interest rate , which is random , time-dependent and measurable .
Stocks
Stock prices are modeled as being similar to that of bonds , except with a randomly fluctuating component ( called its volatility ) . As a premium for the risk originating from these random fluctuations , the mean rate of return of a stock is higher than that of a bond .
Let be the strictly positive prices per share of the stocks , which are continuous stochastic processes satisfying :
Here , gives the volatility of the -th stock , while is its mean rate of return .
In order for an arbitrage-free pricing scenario , must be as defined above . The solution to this is :
and the discounted stock prices are :
Note that the contribution due to the discontinuities in the bond price does not appear in this equation .
Dividend rate
Each stock may have an associated dividend rate process giving the rate of dividend payment per-unit price of the stock at time . Accounting for this in the model , gives the yield process :
Portfolio and gain processes
Definition
Consider a financial market .
A portfolio process for this market is an measurable , valued process such that :
, almost surely ,
, almost surely , and
, almost surely .
The gains process for this portfolio is :
We say that the portfolio is self-financed if :
.
It turns out that for a self-financed portfolio , the appropriate value of is determined from and therefore sometimes is referred to as the portfolio process . Also , implies borrowing money from the money-market , while implies taking a short position on the stock .
The term in the SDE of is the risk premium process , and it is the compensation received in return for investing in the -th stock .
Motivation
Consider time intervals , and let be the number of shares of asset , held in a portfolio during time interval at time . To avoid the case of insider trading ( i.e . foreknowledge of the future ) , it is required that is measurable .
Therefore , the incremental gains at each trading interval from such a portfolio is :
and is the total gain over time , while the total value of the portfolio is .
Define , let the time partition go to zero , and substitute for as defined earlier , to get the corresponding SDE for the gains process . Here denotes the dollar amount invested in asset at time , not the number of shares held .
Income and wealth processes
Definition
Given a financial market , then a cumulative income process is a semimartingale and represents the income accumulated over time , due to sources other than the investments in the assets of the financial market .
A wealth process is then defined as :
and represents the total wealth of an investor at time . The portfolio is said to be -financed if :
The corresponding SDE for the wealth process , through appropriate substitutions , becomes :
.
Note , that again in this case , the value of can be determined from .
Viable markets
The standard theory of mathematical finance is restricted to viable financial markets , i.e . those in which there are no opportunities for arbitrage . If such opportunities exists , it implies the possibility of making an arbitrarily large risk-free profit .
Definition
In a financial market , a self-financed portfolio process is considered to be an arbitrage opportunity if the associated gains process , almost surely and strictly . A market in which no such portfolio exists is said to be viable .
Implications
In a viable market , there exists a adapted process such that for almost every :
.
This is called the market price of risk and relates the premium for the -the stock with its volatility .
Conversely , if there exists a D-dimensional process such that it satisfies the above requirement , and :
,
then the market is viable .
Also , a viable market can have only one money-market ( bond ) and hence only one risk-free rate . Therefore , if the -th stock entails no risk ( i.e . ) and pays no dividend ( i.e . ) , then its rate of return is equal to the money market rate ( i.e . ) and its price tracks that of the bond ( i.e . ) .
Standard financial market
Definition
A financial market is said to be standard if :
( i ) It is viable .
( ii ) The number of stocks is not greater than the dimension of the underlying Brownian motion process .
( iii ) The market price of risk process satisfies :
, almost surely .
( iv ) The positive process is a martingale .
Comments
In case the number of stocks is greater than the dimension , in violation of point ( ii ) , from linear algebra , it can be seen that there are stocks whose volatilities ( given by the vector ) are linear combination of the volatilities of other stocks ( because the rank of is ) . Therefore , the stocks can be replaced by equivalent mutual funds .
The standard martingale measure on for the standard market , is defined as :
.
Note that and are absolutely continuous with respect to each other , i.e . they are equivalent . Also , according to Girsanov 's theorem ,
,
is a -dimensional Brownian motion process on the filtration with respect to .
Complete financial markets
A complete financial market is one that allows effective hedging of the risk inherent in any investment strategy .
Definition
Let be a standard financial market , and be an -measurable random variable , such that :
.
,
The market is said to be complete if every such is financeable , i.e . if there is an -financed portfolio process , such that its associated wealth process satisfies
, almost surely .
Motivation
If a particular investment strategy calls for a payment at time , the amount of which is unknown at time , then a conservative strategy would be to set aside an amount in order to cover the payment . However , in a complete market it is possible to set aside less capital ( viz . ) and invest it so that at time it has grown to match the size of .
Corollary
A standard financial market is complete if and only if , and the volalatily process is non-singular for almost every , with respect to the Lebesgue measure .

Carl Wieland ( born 1950 ) is an Australian young earth creationist , author and speaker . He was the Managing Director of Creation Ministries International ( formerly Answers in Genesis - Australia ) , a Creationist apologetics ministry . CMI are the distributors of Creation magazine and the Journal of Creation .
Biography
Wieland is a medical doctor who graduated from Adelaide University in South Australia but he stopped practising medicine in 1986 . This was due to an accident Wieland was in with `` a fully laden fuel tanker at highway speeds . '' He endured five and a half months in hospital and has undergone more than fifty operations , as discussed in his book , Walking Through Shadows . He is a past president of the Christian Medical Fellowship of South Australia .
Wieland has said that during his time at university he was an atheist . In 1976 Wieland formed the Creation Science Association ( CSA ) , a South Australian creationist organisation modelled after the Creation Research Society . In 1978 this organisation began publishing a magazine , Ex Nihilo ( later called Creation Ex Nihilo ) , `` to explain and promote special creation as a valid scientific explanation of origins . '' In 1980 , CSA merged with a Queensland group to form the Creation Science Foundation , which subsequently became Answers in Genesis ( AiG ) .
In 2005 AiG split as a result of long-standing disagreements between Carl Wieland , CEO of AiG-Australia and Ken Ham , CEO of AiG-US . Ham retained leadership of the AiG 's United States and United Kingdom branches under the AiG name , while Wieland retained the Australian branch and affiliation with the Canadian , New Zealand and South African branches , under the name Creation Ministries International , and established CMI offices both the United States and the United Kingdom .
On 6 March 2015 , Wieland retired from active creation ministry , and stepped down as CEO of CMI-Australia .

Patrick Topaloff ( 30 December 1944 – 7 March 2010 ) was a French comedian , singer , and actor .
The son of a Georgian father and a Corsican mother which , according to him , made him `` a delicate Franco-Russian dessert '' , Topaloff began his career on Europe 1 , where his comic antics drew a wide audience , especially among children who delighted in his many silly catch phrases . Popular singer Claude François encouraged him to try his hand at singing , and his recording of `` Il Vaut Bien Mieux Etre Jeune , Riche et Beau '' ( `` It 's Much Better to Be Young , Rich , and Beautiful '' ) became a major hit and the first of several gold records .
In the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s , writer/director Philippe Clair cast Topaloff in a number of slapstick comedy films similar to the Carry On series in the UK or those made by Jerry Lewis in the US after splitting with Dean Martin . His last feature film was Drôles de Zèbres for writer/director Guy Lux in 1977 .
In his later years , problems in Topaloff 's private life overshadowed his professional successes . Deeply in debt , he frequently worked without billing in an effort to avoid liens being placed on his salary . In 1995 , he was sentenced to a year in prison for non-payment of alimony and taxes . Paroled after four months , he undertook a new and successful stage career .
Death
He died , aged 65 , from a heart attack . His autobiography , Les Pleurs du Rire ( Tears of Laughter ) , was a major bestseller .

is a Japanese science fiction original video animation ( OVA ) short film created and animated by Makoto Shinkai . It follows the lives of two close childhood friends , a boy and a girl , who get separated once the girl is sent into space to fight in a war against aliens . As the 15-year-old girl goes deeper and deeper into space , the texts she sends take longer to reach the Earth ; the film simultaneously follows her battles and the boy 's life as he receives her texts over the years .
The OVA premiered in Japan in February 2002 in an advance screening . It was followed by two DVD releases on April 19 and October 6 , 2002 . ADV Films licensed the OVA for release in North America and the United Kingdom , Madman Entertainment licensed it for Australasia , and Anime Limited licensed it for the United Kingdom . In 2002 , it won the Animation Kobe award for packaged work . It also won the 2003 Seiun Award for Best Media . It was very positively received by critics , who praised its artistic dimension , plot , and music ; the English-language version , however was criticized for its dubbing .
The OVA was adapted into a drama CD by Pioneer LDC and a novel was written by Waku Ōba , illustrated by Makoto Shinkai and Kou Yaginuma , and published by Media Factory 's imprint MF Bunko J. Makoto Shinkai adapted a manga from the OVA , illustrated by Mizu Sahara ; Kodansha serialized it in its manga magazine , Afternoon , from April 2004 , and released the manga as a one-shot on February 23 , 2005 . The manga was licensed for a North American release by Tokyopop , which published it on August 1 , 2006 .
Plot
A schoolgirl named Mikako Nagamine ( Mika Shinohara ( original Japanese ) , Sumi Muto ( Japanese ) , Cynthia Martinez ( English ) ) is recruited into the UN Space Army to fight in a war against a group of aliens called the Tarsiansnamed after the Tharsis region of Mars where they were first encountered . As a Special Agent , Mikako pilots a giant robotic mecha called a Tracer as part of a fighting squadron attached to the spacecraft carrier Lysithea . When the Lysithea leaves Earth to search for the Tarsians , Mikako 's friend Noboru Terao ( Makoto Shinkai ( original Japanese ) , Chihiro Suzuki ( Japanese ) , Adam Colon ( English ) ) remains on Earth . The two continue to communicate across space using the e-mail facilities on their mobile telephones . As the Lysithea travels deeper into space , messages take increasingly longer to reach Noboru on Earth , and the time-lag of their correspondence eventually spans years .
The narrative begins in 2047 . Mikako is apparently alone in a hauntingly empty city , trying to contact people through her mobile telephone . She wakes up in her Tracer orbiting an extrasolar planet . She then goes to Agartha , the fictional fourth planet of the Sirius Solar System . Mikako sends an e-mail to Noboru ( which shows the date 2047-09-16 ) , with the subject `` I am here '' , which would reach him eight years later . Some flashes of imagery , perhaps indicative of memory , a hallucination , or even a mystical encounter , are then shown . The room shown at the beginning of the animation is presented again ; Mikako is squatting in the corner , sobbing and pleading with her doppelganger to let her see Noboru again so she can tell him she loves him .
The ship 's alarm warns Mikako that the Tarsians are surrounding her , but she does not understand . A climactic battle ensues . On Earth , Noboru receives the message almost nine years later . At Agartha , three of the four carriers equipped with the warp engines which brought the expeditionary force to Sirius have been destroyed . The Lysithea is still intact after Mikako joins the fight and stops its destruction . After winning the battle , Mikako lets her damaged Tracer drift in space .
In the manga , 16-year-old Mikako sends a message to 25-year-old Noboru , telling him that she loves him . By this time , Noboru himself has joined the UN , which has launched a rescue mission for the Lysithea . When Mikako hears that the UN is sending help for their rescue , she consults a list of people on the mission , and finds that Noboru is among them . The manga ends with Mikako saying that they will definitely meet again .
Production
Voices of a Distant Star was written , directed and produced by Makoto Shinkai on his Power Mac G4 using LightWave , Adobe Photoshop 5.0 , Adobe After Effects 4.1 and Commotion 3.1 DV software . Around June 2000 , Shinkai drew the first picture for Voicesof a girl holding a mobile telephone in a cockpit .
Shinkai said the OVA was inspired by Dracula and Laputa . He stated that production took seven months to complete . He said another inspiration was his frequent sending of text messaging to his wife when he was working . Shinkai cited the availability of digital hardware and software tools for image production at his workplace , Falcom , and friends ' view that individual film production could occur because of the improvement of consumer electronics .
Makoto and his then girlfriend , Mika Shinohara , provided the voice acting for the working dub . A second Japanese dub was later created for the DVD release with professional voice actors . Makoto 's friend Tenmon , who had worked with Makoto 's video game company , provided the soundtrack . The song and film were created together in sync during storyboarding . Sometimes , the timing of the animation had to be changed to match the music .
The ending theme to the OVA , `` Through the Years and Far Away '' ( Hello , Little Star ) , was composed by Tenmon , with lyrics written by K. Juno and sung by Low .

Reception
Voices of A Distant Star has received the Special Prize at the 6th Japan Media Arts Festival . It has also won the Animation Kobe for packaged work in 2002 and the 2003 Seiun Award for best media . The film was listed 100th on DVD Verdict 's Top 100 DVD Films list .
Anime News Network 's Jonathan Mays criticized Steven Foster 's dubbing of the film . He said , `` Foster carelessly omits critical details , completely rewrites some scenes , misinterprets emotions , and even adds new dialogue where the original track had silence '' . In an Anime News Network interview , Foster said he `` made some changes to make the jokes more accessible '' . Mays also said , `` The animation is breathtaking . Shinkai 's backgrounds have very few equals . The character designs look uninspired , but paired with the animator 's beautifully realized worlds , the generic appearance fades into the magnificence of the scene . '' He said Shinkai 's use of lighting is `` masterful '' , `` incredibly realistic '' and conveys the characters ' moods well . He called the characters `` unoriginal '' . DVD Verdict 's Rob Lineberger commended the music , saying `` the simple score infuses the animation with meaning . Solitary piano notes are sluggish , as though the pianist lacked the enthusiasm needed to pick up his fingers . When the action kicks in , it arrives with a sonic punch from 5.1 speakers . Rockets scream around you , birds move overhead , engines thrum quietly in your wake . The soundtrack does what it is supposed to do : transport you to another world '' .
THEM Anime Review 's Carlos Ross said , `` The voice-acting is remarkable , the directing is solid , and music is quite competent . But the real kicker here is the animation quality , which actually equals ( and sometimes exceeds ) that of excellent television series like Vandread and Full Metal Panic ... there is a remarkable amount of storyline ; the plot is well-written and executed , and never gets a chance to be too drawn out . And Shinkai gives equal time to the slick action sequences and the well-handled , genuinely touching romance '' . IGN 's A.E . Sparrow said , `` While [ the film ] was visually one of the best pieces of eye-candy I have seen in a year or so , it 's ultimately a voice track over a sequence of pretty pictures . Do n't get me wrong , it was absolutely beautiful , but it left me wanting more '' . Mania 's Chris Beveridge commended ADV Films for obtaining the original computer files that were used to create it . He said , `` the transfer here is simply gorgeous . Colors are amazingly lush and deep , saturated without bleeding . Cross coloration is non-existent and only a few very minor areas of aliasing occur . The only real 'flaw ' that I could see with this transfer is during some of the panning sequences up and down , there 's a slight stutter that 's simply inherent in the materials '' . DVDs Worth Watching 's Johanna Draper Carlson said , `` the character designs are familiar and uninspired , and the cross-cutting choppy '' .
IGN 's A.E . Sparrow said that compared with the film , the manga has `` a healthy amount of additional storylines , characters and dialogue ... `` He also said , `` Mizu Sahara 's artwork brings a bit of clarity to scenes that might have come off as muddled in the anime '' . Anime News Network 's Theron Martin said the manga has `` strong storytelling which carries good emotional appeal , fleshes out the original anime '' but said it `` unnecessarily adds on to the ending '' , and that `` character designs were not Shinkai 's strong point , and Sahara 's are only a slight improvement '' .
Manga Worth Reading 's Johanna Draper Carlson said , `` the art is denser than in many manga , with toned backgrounds anchoring the drawn world . Faces are often in shadow , suggesting separation and loss . '' Pop Culture Shock 's Melinda Beasi wrote , `` the manga is absolutely beautiful . The art is nicely detailed and very expressive , and the panel layouts , including the placement and style of dialogue and narrative text , make the story visually interesting and easy to follow '' . She also said , `` Sahara also spends more time exploring both Mikako 's and Noboru 's feelings about Mikako 's appointment to the Lysithea , which is very revealing for both characters '' . Mania.com 's Sakura Eries said , stating `` there 's not a lot of detail in the backgrounds , the mecha designs are dull , and the warp scenes , which were so spectacular in the anime , do n't make much of an impact '' .

Grant-Lee Phillips ( born Bryan G. Phillips ; September 1 , 1963 ) is an American singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist . He led the group Grant Lee Buffalo in the 1990s , afterwards launching a solo career . He features as the town troubadour in Gilmore Girls .
Background
Born in Stockton , California , Phillips began playing the guitar in his early teens . At age 19 , he moved to Los Angeles where he worked tarring roofs to fund evening classes at UCLA and forming bands . He eventually dropped out of college and linked up with an old friend from Stockton named Jeffrey Clark . In the late 1980s , Phillips lived on campus at CalArts with future wife Denise Siegel , whom he met at a party through a fellow student and first Shiva Burlesque bassist , James Brenner . Phillips informally took art classes , went to public lectures and film screenings , and immersed himself in the school 's World Music program until 1990 . Shiva Burlesque released two LPs , Shiva Burlesque ( Nate Starkman & Son ; 1987 ) and Mercury Blues ( Fundamental ; 1990 ) . Brenner was replaced by Paul Kimble , thus completing what would be the basis of Grant-Lee Buffalo . But Shiva Burlesque made no commercial impact , and Phillips and Clark disbanded in 1990 . Phillips began playing solo around Los Angeles under the stage name Grant Lee Buffalo .
Grant Lee Buffalo
Following this handful of solo shows at clubs around Hollywood , Phillips recruited ex-Shiva members Joey Peters ( drums ) and Paul Kimble ( bass ) for rehearsals as Grant Lee Buffalo in mid-1991 . Phillips was now writing lyrics as well as music , and the trio quickly built up a local following , selling out clubs on the strength of Phillips 's intense performance . His political storytelling was delivered in a recently discovered voice : both a soaring falsetto and a drawl that matched his aggressive acoustic guitar stomp and pouting physicality . One song , `` Fuzzy '' , was released on Bob Mould 's Singles Only label in 1992 to critical praise and led to Grant Lee Buffalo being signed to Slash Records . The debut LP , also called Fuzzy , was released a year later , upon which Michael Stipe of R.E.M . declared it `` the best album of the year hands down '' . In 1995 Grant-Lee Phillips was named the critics ' choice for Best Male Vocalist of 1995 .
A further three Grant Lee Buffalo albums followed : Mighty Joe Moon ( 1994 ) , Copperopolis ( 1996 ) , and Jubilee ( 1998 ) . A live performance of Mighty Joe Moons title track is available online from the South by Southwest festival . Though all were heavily promoted through concert touring , they never escaped cult status . Phillips disbanded the band in early 1999 .
Solo career
Phillips signed to the Boston-based indie label Rounder Records and launched a solo career , issuing Ladies ' Love Oracle online in 2000 . The recording was later more widely released . His first full-length album , Mobilize , was released in 2001 . Being praised as much for its gentleness as Buffalo were for their rock , it featured Phillips on many instruments .
During a short tour with Robyn Hitchcock , Phillips co-produced and co-starred in a concert film of the tour shot in Seattle titled Elixirs & Remedies , directed by Kris Kristensen . Kristensen would later direct the video for `` The Sun Shines on Jupiter '' , from Phillips ' solo release `` Little Moon '' .
In 2004 Virginia Creeper arrived and with it a more folky , almost country record noted for its complete absence of electric guitar . In 2006 Phillips released another acoustic album , Nineteeneighties . A set of cover versions , it featured songs from The Smiths , Pixies , New Order , Robyn Hitchcock , R.E.M. , The Church , and Echo & the Bunnymen . A new record of his own material , Strangelet , was released on March 27 , 2007 . On October 13 , 2009 , Grant released `` Little Moon '' on Yep Roc records . In October 2012 , `` Walking in the Green Corn '' was released , partially funded by fans through a PledgeMusic campaign . Phillips toured with Glen Phillips to support the album .
Grant-Lee Phillips is a registered member of the Creek Native American tribe ( on his mother 's side ) and a direct descendant of those who walked the Trail of Tears .
Phillips is related to Chief John Ross on his father 's side . Paternally he is of both Blackfoot and Cherokee ancestry .
Phillips has been married for more than 20 years . He became father to Violet Thea Phillips , January 11 , 2008 .
Phillips has scored several films and TV shows as well as having a recurring role as the town troubadour on the 2000–2007 TV series Gilmore Girls and its follow-up miniseries in 2016 .
Phillips has a comedic background , having been a cast member in high school of the only professional theater in Stockton , Pollardville .
Phillips has co-written songs with numerous people , most recently with comedian Margaret Cho . He can be seen featured in her video `` Asian Adjacent . '' The song was partially inspired by Phillips and Jemaine Clement ( of Flight of the Conchords ) , who is part Māori .
In 2015 , Phillips released The Narrows , which extends Phillips ' exploration of roots and folk music .

In theoretical computer science , the closest string is an NP-hard computational problem , which tries to find the geometrical center of a set of input strings .
To understand the word `` center '' , it is necessary to define a distance between two strings . Usually , this problem is studied with the Hamming distance in mind .
Formal definition
More formally , given n length-m strings s1 , s2 , ... , sn , the closest string problem seeks for a new length-m string s such that d ( s , si ) ≤ k for all i , where d denotes the Hamming distance , and where k is as small as possible . A decision problem version of the closest string problem , which is NP-complete , instead takes k as another input and questions whether there is a string within Hamming distance k of all the input strings .
The closest string problem can be seen as a special case of the generic 1-center problem in which the distances between elements are measured using Hamming distance .
Motivation
In bioinformatics , the closest string problem is an intensively studied facet of the problem of finding signals in DNA .
Simplifications and data reductions
Instances of the closest string may contain information that is not essential to the problem . In some sense , the usual input of the closest string contains information , that does not contribute to the hardness of the problem . For example , if some strings contain the character a , but none contains the character z , replacing all as with zs would yield an essentially equivalent instance , that is : from a solution of the modified instance , the original solution can be restored , and vice versa .
Normalizing the input
When all input strings that share the same length are written on top of each other , they form a matrix . Certain row types have essentially the same implications to the solution . For example , replacing a column with entries ( a , a , b ) with another column ( x , x , y ) might lead to a different solution string , but can not affect solvability , because both columns express the same structure , viz . the first two entries being equal , but different from the third one .
An input instance can be normalized by replacing , in each column , the character that occurs the most often with a , the character that occurs the second most often with b , and so forth . Given a solution to the normalized instance , the original instance can be found by remapping the characters of the solution to its original version in every column .
The order of the columns does not contribute to the hardness of the problem . That means , if we permute all input strings according to a certain permutation π and obtain a solution string s to that modified instance , then π−1 ( s ) will be a solution to the original instance .
Example
Given an instance with three input strings uvwx , xuwv , and xvwu . This could be written as a matrix like this :
The first column has the values ( u , x , x ) . As x is the character that appears the most often , we replace it by a , and we replace u , the second most often character , by b , obtaining the new first column ( b , a , a ) . The second column has the values ( v , u , v ) . As for the first column , v is replaced by a and u is replaced by b , obtaining the new second column ( a , b , a ) . Doing the same with all columns gives the normalized instance
Data reduction obtained from normalization
Normalizing the input reduces the alphabet size to at most the number of input strings . This can be useful for algorithms whose running times depend on the alphabet size .
Approximability
Li et al . evolved a polynomial-time approximation scheme which is practically unusable because of the large hidden constants .
Fixed-parameter tractability
Closest String can be solved in , where k is the number of input strings , L is the length of all strings and d is the desired maximum distance from the solution string to any input string .
Relations to other problems
Closest string is a special case of the more general closest substring problem , which is strictly more difficult . While closest string turns out to be fixed-parameter tractable in a number of ways , the closest substring is W [ 1 ] -hard with regard to these parameters .

Qubur Bene Isra'in or Qubur Bani Isra'il ( lit . `` Tombs of the Children of Israel '' ) , are four , formerly five , huge stone structures dated to the Middle Bronze Age , which rise from a rocky plateau overlooking Wadi Qelt in the West Bank , about 3.5 miles northeast of Jerusalem , between Hizma and Geva Binyamin along Highway 437 .
History
Clermont-Ganneau , followed by Macalister , identified the site with the tomb of the biblical matriarch Rachel based on the biblical text ( ) . It can be hypothesised from the name Qaber Um Bene Israin , `` Tombs of the Mothers of the Sons of Israel '' , that this is the tomb of Rachel ( see ) , or that there is a connection to the death and burial of the nurse Deborah `` below Bethel '' from , as well as to the passage about the oak of Tabor being near Rachel 's tomb in 1 Samuel 10 .
The Israel Antiquities Authority survey gives the site the identification code Hizma , site number 480 in Benjamin , coordinates 17580 and 13880 . Archaeological evidence shows that the site was occupied during the Middle Bronze Age . Excavation work was executed by Tzur Abeles , who published the results in 1997 .
There were originally five structures , but one was demolished in the late 1980s to make way for the Ramallah bypass road .
Louis-Hugues Vincent researched the site and found five very large stone structures , between 10 and 53 metres long and 2.8-6.62 metres high , each with a funerary room in its centre . The rough-hewn stone blocks form rectangular walled structures . Vincent studied the building style and drew the conclusion that they were erected by Bronze Age nomadic shepherds , who would bring their dead back here and bury them inside the structures .
When Vincent asked local inhabitants for the name of the site , they said Qubbur Bene Israin , `` Tombs of the Sons of Israel '' . They called the largest structure Qaber Um Bene Israin , `` Tomb of the Mother of the Sons of Israel '' .

Cardinal Muench Seminary was a Roman Catholic minor seminary located in Fargo , North Dakota , United States . Founded in 1962 as the seminary of the Diocese of Fargo , it reached a peak enrollment of 84 seminarians in 1978 . Enrollment declined in the years that followed , and the seminary closed in 2011 due to low enrollment and high costs .
History
Early years
During the 1950s and 1960s , the Diocese of Fargo , as with dioceses all across the United States , experienced a boom in vocations to the priesthood . Fargo had 97 seminarians by 1956 , up from 60 five years earlier . The Bishop of Fargo , Cardinal Aloisius Joseph Muench , wished to establish a seminary , but retired in 1959 before the project could be begun .
In 1957 , a powerful tornado struck the city of Fargo , destroying hundreds of homes on the north side as well as damaging Sacred Heart Convent and Shanley High School . Cardinal Muench 's successor , Bishop Leo Ferdinand Dworschak , instructed that the now-vacant Sacred Heart Convent be reconstructed as a minor seminary for high school boys . St. Pius X Minor Seminary opened in autumn 1962 . After Cardinal Muench died in February of that year , the seminary was renamed in his honor , though it still remained under the patronage of St. Pius X. Bishop Dworschak expounded on the reason for the renaming , writing at the time : '' Before he could launch the project of a seminary he was called upon to exchange his title of Bishop of Fargo for the high office of a cardinal ; and , before we could actually begin operation of the minor seminary which is now in preparation , Cardinal Muench was called to his eternal reward ... There is no monument to Cardinal Muench that could possibly be more appropriate than an institution dedicated to the work of educating priests ... a work which he recognized as being so necessary in his beloved Diocese of Fargo . There is no way in which we—bishop , clergy , religious and people—can pay a finer tribute to his memory than by supporting the work in which he was so interested through prayer , through encouragement of vocations and through financial help . `` The seminary opened with 41 students , 38 freshman and three juniors . The boys lived at the seminary building ( the former convent ) , located on north Broadway , while attending classes at Shanley High School , which was at the time located on property adjacent to the seminary . The first graduates received diplomas from Shanley High School . By 1964 , the number of seminarians had grown to 65 , and the former Convent of the Sacred Heart building had become inadequate in size . Bishop Dworschak decided that a new facility was necessary , and an 80-acre property was chosen on Fargo 's north side , a short distance . Construction began in 1965 , and was completed in the fall of 1966 , making it the largest building project the Diocese of Fargo had ever undergone . Bishop Dworschak dedicated the new building on August 22 , 1966 . The seminarians began the 1966–1967 academic year at the new building . A full faculty , unaffiliated with Shanley High School , was hired , and the high school program received independent accreditation . All classes were taught at the new campus and diplomas were now awarded by Cardinal Muench Seminary .
In 1966 , the seminary commenced a program for college-age men . The administration reached an agreement between the seminary , North Dakota State University , and the North Dakota Board of Higher Education . Now , Cardinal Muench seminarians would matriculate to North Dakota State , and the seminary would provide philosophy , humanities , and classics instructors to the university . Beginning in 1972 , the seminary began to enroll men from other dioceses in both the college and high school programs . In the years that followed , seminarians were enrolled from 12 dioceses besides the Diocese of Fargo . in that same year , the first Cardinal Muench alumnus was ordained to the priesthood .
Also in 1972 , Cardinal Muench Seminary tweaked its curriculum to accommodate seminarians who had already graduated from college . That year , the seminary enrolled its first student who already had a baccalaureate degree . Given that the curriculum was designed for men who had not yet earned a college degree , seminarians who already had one were at first known as `` special students . '' Later , the seminary developed its Pre-Theology Program for these seminarians . The program was originally one year , but when the US Conference of Catholic Bishops changed its requirements for priestly formation , it was lengthened to two years .
During the late 1980s and early 1990s , the seminary , in conjunction with the Diocese of Fargo , began increasing outreach efforts to attract seminarians . in 1989 , the Rev . Valentine Gross , the Rector of Cardinal Muench Seminary , designed an aptitude and interest test for middle school and high school students to contemplate a priestly vocation . In 1991 , the seminary started the Vianney Discernment Program to help young men discern their vocation . The men lived in community , praying together and receiving spiritual direction . During the program 's existence , 40 men participated , 15 of whom entered seminary , and as of 2013 , six have been ordained priests . Despite these efforts , the high school program continued to decline in enrollment . In 1991 , the high school program stopped having an independent faculty and the seminarians began attending classes at Shanley High School , as they had in the past . The last high school seminarian graduated in 2001 , and the program ended .
Bishop Samuel J. Aquila became Bishop of Fargo in 2002 , and despite the declining enrollment , he continued to support the seminary . Effort was made to increase the seminary 's enrollment , but it was unsuccessful . On April 8 , 2010 , Bishop Aquila announced that Cardinal Muench Seminary would close after the next academic year . The seminary officially closed on May 13 , 2011 , the Feast of Our Lady of Fátima . During its 49 years of existence , 923 men participated in Cardinal Muench Seminary programs . The seminary graduated 364 men , 123 of whom have been ordained priests as of 2013 .

Lakhpur is a village near Sahni ( Lakhpur-Sahni ) , Tehsil Phagwara , Kapurthala district , in Punjab , India .
Demographics
, Lakhpur had a population of 1,892 people . As per the 2011 Census , the population is 1,895 people . The village has , of which is woodland . Lakhpur hosts the annual Dussehra Mela which can attract up to 4,000 people .
Neighbouring villages include Sahni ( Lakhpur-Sahni ) , Malikhpur , Begampur , Sangatpur , Chak Prema , Dhadday , Dhadoli and Bir Dhadoli .
History
It is said that the village is named after Maa Lakhi who had two sons and one daughter . The sons descendants are divided into two pattis ( groups of families descending from one common ancestor ) . The pattis are the `` Surjan '' patti and the `` Moru '' patti with the surname Dhadwal or Thadwal . It is believed that Maa Lakhi 's descendants have been living in Lakhpur for the past 25 generations .
Some Dhadwal families have also settled in the village of Jagatpur near Mukandpur in the district of Nawanshahr ( also known as Shahid Bhagat Singh Nagar district ) ; in Apra , near Phillaur ; and Mothada Kalan , also near Phillaur .
The descendants of Maa Lakhi 's daughter settled the neighbouring village of Bir Dhadoli and continue to reside in the village .
Maa Lakhi belonged to a village near Nadalon in Hoshiarpur . The village may have been Ajnoha but this can not be confirmed . Her husband 's family also lived in Hoshiarpur near the present day Himachal Pradesh border . Maa Lakhi 's father gave the couple land to settle on which became known as Lakhpur .
Villagers confirm that Maa Lakhi was a devotee of Bhagat Baba Kalu who lived during the 16th century and built a shrine in Panshta also known as Panchhat . Maa Lakhi took her children to the shrine , especially on Baisakhi . Therefore , the period when the village was settled could be at any time during the 16th century , making the village at least 400 years old .
According to local tradition , Lakhpur was already an established village at the time when Sri Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji visited Lakhpur whilst he was travelling from Kartarpur to Kiratpur Sahib , and then visited Palahi ( near Phagwara ) in 1635 , where he was involved in a battle against the Mughals led by Ahmad Khan . It is said that Guru Ji visited Lakhpur before visiting Chak Prema and stopping at Palahi . Guru Ji also visited Domeli , Hadiabad and Phagwara where Gurdwaras have been built in memory of the visit .
Around Lakhpur
The village has four Gurdwaras . The oldest , Gurdwara Sahib Guru Granth Sahib , is managed by the Shromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee . The dharamsal of Bhagat Jawala Dass Ji is currently being reconstructed and will be the fifth Gurdwara .
The village also has a pharmacy , a Mandir , the shrine of Lakha Datta Pir ( Sakhi Sarwar ) , the dharamsals of Baba Ram Dass Ji , Baba Amar Dass Ji and Guru Ravidas Ji , the Baba Balak Nath Mandir and shrine of Bhagat Baba Kalu , a primary school , Government Secondary School ( which runs the Galaxy Science Club ) , a Post Office , Shaheed Shrines , a bank , a Mosque , Jathera and some shops . The nearest railway station is in Phagwara . The nearest police station is the Rawal Pindi . police station .
Sports tournament
A Kabbaddi and sports tournament was hosted at the Lakhpur Government Senior Secondary School between 4 and 6 March 2011 . Various villages entered the tournament which included Sangatpur , Jagpalpur , Ghumana , Manaka , Harkowal and Akalgarh .
Religion
Lakhpur is a mix of Sikhs and Hindus . It also has a Muslim Gujjar and Bazigar settlement .
Location of Lakhpur
Lakhpur is located east of the Phagwara-Hoshiarpur Road . Heading north from Phagwara for 5 km , one must turn right opposite Khatti and travel for 2.2 km on the Chak Prema-Lakhpur Road .
Gurdwara Sahib Guru Granth Sahib
During the times of Guru Arjan Dev Ji , the village was known as Lakhu Pur . People of the village used to go to Amritsar to pay homage to Guru Arjan Dev Ji . Remembering this , Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji and Sri Guru Har Rai Sahib Ji visited Lakhpur where they held congregations to preach about Sikhism .
The people of Lakhpur built a dharamshala on the spot where the congregations were held . Later , Gurdwara Sahib Guru Granth Sahib was built on the same exact spot .
Chitti Bein and the Great Flood
The Chitti ( White ) Bein passes through all districts of doaba and drains into the Sutlej , near Harike in Amritsar District . It also flows near Lakhpur .
Locals recall the flood of the mid 1940s , known as the Great Flood . It is said that the Chitti Bein breached its banks at a number of places , causing severe devastation . The water reached as far as the gate of the middle part of Lakhpur .
So much damage was caused to the G.T Road near Chiheru that a new section of the Road had to be constructed .
The Chitti Bein is prone to seasonal flooding because seasonal torrent ( stream ) /torrents , known in Punjabi as choes , drain into it . The most famous are the Maili Choe ; the Jammanwala Choe and the Nasrala Choe .
The Maili Choe takes its name from the Maili Dam near the village of Maili in Hoshiarpur District . It merges with the Chitti Bein near the village of Cheta ( Nawanshahr District ) .
The Jamanwala Choe winds it way through Hoshiarpur district flowing near the villages of Panchhat , Narur , Nasirabad and drains into the Chitti Bein near Malikhpur . Both these choes drain into the Chitti Bein prior to flowing near Lakhpur . It is for this reason that there is wetland , near the Lakhpur woodland , which is caused when the Chitti Bein breaches its bank .
After flowing near Lakhpur , the Chitti Bein flows for some kilometres , and is joined by the Nasrala Choe which takes its name from the Nasrala bridge near the village of Nasrala on the Hoshiarpur-Jalandhar Road . It merges with the Chitti Bein near the village of Ucha . The Narur choe joins the Nasrala Choe near the village of Babeli .

Berger v. North Carolina State Conference of the NAACP , 597 U.S. ___ ( 2022 ) , was a United States Supreme Court case related to the ability of state officials to intervene to defend the constitutionality of state laws .
Background
In 2013 , the North Carolina General Assembly passed , and Governor Pat McCrory signed , HB 589 , a voter identification law . A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit invalidated that law in 2016 , and the Supreme Court later denied a petition for a writ of certiorari in 2017 after disputes about whether North Carolina 's new governor , Roy Cooper , could withdraw the petition . In November 2018 , the people of North Carolina adopted a voter identification amendment to the Constitution of North Carolina , and the General Assembly then passed SB 824 to implement the amendment in December 2018 , over Cooper 's veto .
After the HB 589 litigation , the General Assembly modified state law , again over Cooper 's veto , to direct that the Speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the North Carolina Senate be able to intervene in any litigation over the constitutionality of state law .
The North Carolina State Conference of the NAACP filed suit against SB 824 in the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina in late December 2018 . The General Assembly sought to intervene in defense of the law twice , believing North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein was not adequately defending the law . The district court denied both motions , asserting that Stein would defend the law fairly . The General Assembly appealed , and a divided panel of the Fourth Circuit reversed in an opinion written by Judge A. Marvin Quattlebaum Jr. Judge Pamela Harris dissented . The court of appeals granted rehearing en banc , and affirmed the district court by a 9–6 vote . The General Assembly subsequently filed a petition for a writ of certiorari .
Supreme Court
Certiorari was granted in the case on November 24 , 2021 . Oral arguments were held on March 21 , 2022 . On June 23 , 2022 , the Supreme Court reversed the Fourth Circuit in an 8–1 vote . Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote the majority opinion , while Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented . The Supreme Court court means that Republican legislators in the state of North Carolina can act and advocate for a voter-identification law that they believe the state 's attorney general , a Democrat , is n't defending adequately in court . The Court rejected the idea that courts should just presume that representation is adequate where the state law has explicitly authorized some other party to intervene in the process .

In Islam , prophecy ( , nubuwwah ) is the principle that God has appointed exemplary individuals , i.e . prophets and messengers to communicate His guidance to humanity . This is one of the five principles of the Twelver Principles of Religion .
According to Henry Corbin , the oldest traditions that form the basis of Islamic prophetology come from the teachings of the Shia Imams , and Shia milieu was propitious for the rise , study and development of this scholastic field . He holds that `` divine science '' is not an ordinary science , impossible to communicate in the conventional manner , except by a prophet . The circumstances of this communication is the object of Islamic prophetology . According to the Ayatollah Ja'far Sobhani , prophets are the medium for the flow of Divine grace to humans who have been sent down by God since first humans had deserved it until the time of Muhammad prophet of Islam .
For guidance of servants of God , prophets should possess some qualities : Wahy ( God 's word is delivered by his chosen individuals – known as Messengers prophets – to mankind ) , Ismah ( moral infallibility ) and Miracle .
Etymology
In the Quran , both `` prophet '' ( , nabī ) and `` messenger '' ( , rasūl ) is used to refer to those with God-inspired ministry .
There are differences between a prophet and a messenger . The Twelver scholar Sa'id Akhtar Rizvi stated that a `` messenger '' ( rasūl ) brings a new religious law , while those who do n't are called a `` prophet '' ( nabī ) .
The necessity of prophecy
According to Henry Corbin , the oldest traditions that form the basis of Islamic prophetology come from the teachings of the Shia Imams , and Shia milieu was propitious for the rise , study and development of this scholastic field .
Henry Corbin holds that `` divine science '' is not an ordinary science , impossible to communicate in the conventional manner , except by a prophet . The circumstances of this communication is the object of Islamic prophetology .
According to the view of Ayatollah Ja'far Sobhani , the wise God has appointed prominent individuals to guide humans . They have been chosen to deliver messages of God to human . Prophets are the medium for the flow of Divine grace to humans who have been sent down by God since first humans had deserved it until the time of Muhammad prophet of Islam . Since creation of humanity is the act of a wise God it follows a purpose , and considering that humans , in addition to animalistic instincts , possess intellect , this purpose has to be reasonable . On the other hand , human intellect is a necessary means of his evolution , but is not sufficient . Imperfection of human intellect is evidenced in constant controversies over economic , ethical , family and other issues in his life etc . that have resulted in conflicting philosophies . Based on these contemplations , a sound mind rules that consistent with Divine wisdom , leaders and teachers have to be inspired to teach humans the correct way of life .
In view of the Quran
The following reasons have been mentioned in the Quran for Divine appointment of prophets :
Strengthening the foundations of Tawhid ( the oneness [ of God ] ) and fight against any deviation as in sura An-Nahl , verse 36 : `` And We certainly sent into every nation a messenger , [ saying ] , `` Worship Allah and avoid Taghut . '' And among them were those whom Allah guided , and among them were those upon whom error was [ deservedly ] decreed . So proceed through the earth and observe how was the end of the deniers '' . On the purpose of Prophethood , Ali ibn Abi Talib , the first Shia Imam and cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad , in a sermon during his caliphacy , has said that Allah assigned the prophets mission to teach the servants of God about Tawhid and attributes of God .
To acquaint people with the divine teachings and the manner of purification of the soul as in sura Al-Jumua , verse 2 : `` It is He who has sent among the unlettered a Messenger from themselves reciting to them His verses and purifying them and teaching them the Book and wisdom - although they were before in clear error – ''
To establish justice in human society , as in sura Al-Hadid verse 25 : `` We have already sent Our messengers with clear evidences and sent down with them the Scripture and the balance that the people may maintain [ their affairs ] in justice '' .
To judge disputes among humans as in sura Al-Baqara , verse 213 : '' Mankind was [ of ] one religion [ before their deviation ] ; then Allah sent the prophets as bringers of good tidings and warners and sent down with them the Scripture in truth to judge between the people concerning that in which they differed . And none differed over the Scripture except those who were given it - after the clear proofs came to them - out of jealous animosity among themselves . ''
As a final ‘ hujjah ' ( argument , proof , guarantee ) for servants of God , as in sura An-Nisa verse 165 : '' [ We sent ] messengers as bringers of good tidings and warners so that mankind will have no argument against Allah after the messengers . And ever is Allah Exalted in Might and Wise '' . In Shia Islam , Prophets and Imams are considered to be God 's proof for humankind .
Qualities of prophets
For guidance of servants of God , prophets should possess some qualities :
Wahy
According to the thesis of general guidance , elaborated by Tabataba ' i , God guides the development of every creature towards a final end that represents its full perfection . Like plants and animals , humans are also subject to this general guidance ; however , given man 's distinguishing feature which is his faculty of intellect , he is , in addition , in need of a special form of guidance in order to acquire his respective perfection .
Man as a thinking species realizes the importance of social cooperation and law for his survival and happiness , but he is unable by the virtue of his reason alone to arrive at the true universal laws that are necessary for governance of his personal and social life . `` If it had been in the very nature of things that it be the duty of human reason to create a perfect common law which must provide happiness for human society , and that man should be guided to that perfect law through the process of creation and the generation of the world itself , then such laws would have been apprehended by each human being through his reason in the same way that man knows what is of benefit or detriment to him throughout the determined course of daily life . '' Therefore , there has to be another power of apprehension to help humanity understand his real duties and one that makes this knowledge available to all . This power which is different from human intellect and sense , is the prophetic consciousness or the consciousness of revelation
According to Morteza Motahhari , divine revelation to the Prophet has some characteristics that distinguish it from other forms of inspiration :
Internality : Revelation is a form of internal realization that does not rely on sense perception . This is evident in psychological conditions that affected the Prophet of Islam while receiving revelation , such as fainting and disconnection from the external world .
Being taught : In the process of revelation , Prophet is subject to an act of teaching by a mysterious authority who informs him about things he does not know by his own virtue or through conventional methods of learning .
Consciousness of the source : During the process of revelation , the Prophet has a clear consciousness of the fact that he 's being enlightened by an external transcendent source , just as a schoolchild is aware that he is being taught by a human teacher .
Consciousness of the medium : Revelation often occurs via mediation of a being usually referred to as Gabriel or the Holy Spirit . Unlike instinctual or poetic inspiration , Prophet is fully aware of the existence of this medium and its role .
Ismah
Prophets were individuals with claim of prophecy and revelation . They provide proofs to back up their claim . They brought forth elements of Divine religion i.e . the divine law that guarantees happiness of humankind , and made it available to all . Moreover , since the number of prophets with power of prophecy and revelation has been small , Allah has provided guidance to the rest of humanity through the prophets themselves . For prophets to be able to fulfill this role , they have to possess the quality of inerrancy .
Miracle
Prophets who are able to receive and declare Divine doctrines and laws through Revelation , first need to prove their claim of connection with the transcendent world to the people before expecting them to submit to their religion . Indeed , historically people have demanded prophets proof of their prophecy , and the Quran has recognized the legitimacy of this demand . This demand for proof is answered by acts of miracle by Prophets . Miracles are not logically impossible acts , but rather are a `` break in what is habitual '' ( kharq-i ‘ adat ) , a phenomenon that is often observed in a lower degree among ascetics .
According to Ja'far Sobhani , there are distinctions between Divine miracles and acts that simply break the ordinary affair of things :
Miracles can not be taught : the person who presents a miracle performs that without any training background , whereas other forms of extraordinary acts such as magic are a result of training and exercise .
Miracle is undefiable : Since miracle emanates from the Divine infinite power , they can not be reproduced and equaled by other extraordinary works such as witchcraft .
Variety : Miracles shown by Divine messengers have been diverse e.g . turning a stick into a dragon , splitting the sea , blowing a bird sculpture into a live dove , healing the sick , raising the dead , etc . miracles of Divine messengers do n't follow any fixed prototype .
Performers of miracles differ from performers of magic in aim and character . Prophets follow lofty aims whereas magicians pursue worldly ends , each influencing their characters in distinct ways .
Walayah
As Corbin mentioned in History of Islam , prophecy and walayah ( authority or guardianship ) are among Shia doctrines . One of them is the absolute prophecy that is general and another is particular prophecy . The first one corresponds to Muhammadan Reality from the beginning to eternity . The latter is subordinate to the former and corresponds to prophecy of a particular prophet . For example , the prophecy of the prophet of Islam , Mohammad is the seal of the prophecy . Corbin defines the walayah as the esoteric aspect of eternal prophecy . Walayah is likewise divided into two forms : the absolute walayah and the particular walayah . The prophecy of each prophet emanates from absolute prophecy and according to the Shia doctrine , the walayah of all the men of God ends in the Ttwelfth Imam , Muhammad al-Mahdi .

The Mid West Rhinos is one of the four cricket Zimbabwean cricket franchises . They are a first-class cricket team , based in Midlands Province and the Mashonaland West area . They play their home matches at Kwekwe Sports Club in Kwekwe .
History
In 2009 , Zimbabwe Cricket announced a major restructure of domestic cricket in Zimbabwe and the traditional provincial sides were replaced with regional franchises . Midlands was renamed Mid West Rhinos and based in the mining town of Kwekwe . With the new franchise system in place the season got under way on 14 September 2009 . Current captain Vusimuzi Sibanda was the first person to score a hundred under the new 'Mid West Rhinos ' name as they convincingly beat the newly titled Matabeleland Tuskers by 135 runs . Sadly for the Rhinos , the season ended in a tense draw that saw the Mashonaland Eagles triumph narrowly .
The 2010/11 season was a promising one as the Rhinos retained the services of a number of top Zimbabwe players . Once again , they failed to win any trophies despite winning 4 games and only losing 2 in the newly branded Castle Logan Cup . Throughout the following seasons , the Rhinos have had many successes but failed to win any trophies .
Despite a delay to the start of the 2014/15 season , the season began with the Mid West Rhinos tipped to be one of the stronger sides in both the four day and one day competitions . However , off field issues affecting both the Rhinos and Zimbabwean cricket as a whole meant that the first part of the season saw mixed results . The only win for the Rhinos in the Logan Cup before Christmas came as a result of a poor performance by the Mashonaland Eagles in the season opener . After the Christmas break , the Rhinos showed some strong performances , bolstered by Vusi Sibanda and Malcolm Waller both of whom did not travel to the 2015 World Cup , but the One Day performances were abysmal . At the end of the season , the Rhinos won just 2 Pro50 matches but finished 2nd to Tuskers in the Logan Cup by only 3 points .
Ground Facilities
History
Kwekwe Sports Club has hosted cricket since 1952 . The ground has been developed into one of the finest cricketing venues in the country and has hosted First Class cricket since 1999 . The one and only One Day International at the ground was played on 11 December 2002 between Zimbabwe and Kenya which Zimbabwe won by 47 runs . The ground has however played host to a number of touring teams including West Indies , Australia , South Africa and Bangladesh .
Facilities
The Kwekwe Sports Club square has space for 5 pitches , the centre of which is used only for First Class games . The dimensions of the playing field vary depending on the game being played . For First Class games , the boundary extends to 75 yards straight down on the pitch and 71 yards square of the wicket . The boundaries are reduced for List A , Twenty20 and club cricket .
The practice facilities at the ground are among the best in the country . There are 16 grass nets used for practice that run in an unusual east-west direction . There are also 3 artificial turf nets that are used primarily for throw downs and training on bowling machines .
Ongoing Projects Within the Community
The Mid West Rhinos have been engaged in several projects within the surrounding community .
Midlands Black Rhino Conservancy
The Mid West Rhinos maintain close links with the Midlands Black Rhino Conservancy . The conservancy is made up of several adjoining farms that give free rein to a number of the severely endangered Black Rhino . Each year the Mid West Rhinos stage the Midlands Black Rhino Conservancy T20 tournament . The tournament has grown from humble beginnings and now boasts participating teams from South Africa and Zambia . The proceeds from the tournament and other fundraising activities go directly to the conservancy .
Mbizo Cricket Centre
The largest venture by the Mid West Rhinos is the ongoing Mbizo Cricket centre project . Aimed at developing cricket in the underprivileged high density suburb of Mbizo , the cricket centre was part funded by the Australian Embassy and Indian auto mobile manufacturer Mahindra . The project has been vital in increasing awareness and knowledge of cricket in the area and has resulted in producing a number of decent cricketers . The project stalled in 2014 but in 2015 , the Australian Embassy and prominent businessmen John and Charles Gardiner of the Cold Chain Group provided funds to complement the existing facilities with a large pavilion . Still under construction , the pavilion will include changing rooms , kitchen , running water , electricity and meeting areas .
Whilst the project was slow to gain ground , the support from the local community was immense . When club cricket was played at the centre it would not be unusual to see 60 players arriving on match day vying for a place on the team . Many of the cricketers who played for Mbizo have gone on to represent other local league teams and some have even appeared for the Rhinos .
League Cricket
The Mid West Rhinos are solely responsible for all cricketing activity within the region . As part of their efforts to develop the game the Rhinos introduced a league . The league includes the teams ;
Kwekwe Cricket Club
Kwekwe Queens Cricket Club
Gweru
Chegutu
Chinoyi
Kadoma
Redcliffe Cricket Club
Norton Cricket Club
The strongest of the sides is Kwekwe Cricket Club who consistently beat their opposition convincingly . Whilst League cricket in the area faces numerous difficulties due to the lagging local economy , the standard of cricket is fairly high with a number of the clubs fielding professional players .
Street Cricket
The Mid West Rhinos are embarking on another project to bring `` Street Cricket '' to the suburb of Mbizo . The project which was started by Sporting Chance aims to give young people an opportunity to play a simple version of cricket within their community . Street Cricket can be played with just a bat and ball and it is hoped that by operating this project , the young people will be able to learn new skills and will encourage them to take up the full version of the game .
Sponsorship
Whilst the funding of local cricket comes from Zimbabwe Cricket , there is still a requirement for sponsorship from external sources . The majority of funding for League cricket comes from the Cold Chain Group . The other sponsors include Lays , Bokomo , Castle and local sponsors such as steelmakers , Cricket Tours Africa and Vinyl Stikka Signs .
Notable Former Playing and Coaching Staff
Despite having never won any trophies , the Mid West Rhinos have had a number of star players and coaches .

Gaga ( literally 'touch touch ' ) ( also : ga-ga , gaga ball , or ga-ga ball ) is a variant of dodgeball that is played in a gaga `` pit '' . The game combines dodging , striking , running , and jumping , with the objective of being the last person standing . Players hit the ball at each other with their hands , and are eliminated if the ball strikes them on or below the knee ( occasionally the waist ) . The game can be played by a group of individual players or with teams , as well as in one-on-one matches . Rules , ball types , pit surfaces , and pit sizes can vary widely at different venues .
Gameplay
Gaga is played in a large fenced-in area ( usually an octagon or hexagon ) called a gaga pit . The gaga pit generally consists of flat walls atop a smooth dirt , turf , sand , or rubberized surface . The gaga ball can vary in size and form , generally ranging from a foam dodgeball to a rubber kickball . In some games , the `` ball '' may not actually take the shape of a sphere if the proper equipment is not available . The game begins when one player or a referee throws the gaga ball into the air ; while their backs or hands are set against the wall , the players shout `` Ga '' on each of the first two bounces . After two bounces , the ball is in play , and the players may leave the wall and `` hit '' the ball at each other in the pit . A player who is hit by the ball or breaks a rule is eliminated and must leave the game . Players may not `` hit '' the ball twice in a row , and a player who causes the ball to leave the pit is out . When the ball is caught in the air on a fly , the last person to hit the ball is out .
General rules
A player can hit the ball with their hands , but picking up the ball and throwing it at a player is not allowed . Some versions do not permit `` scooping , '' or curling one 's fingers while hitting the ball so as to project the ball into the air . In some games , only open hand hits are allowed to prevent striking injury to small children and also to enable greater control of the ball , keeping it low and inbounds .
If the ball touches a player anywhere below the knee ( in some versions , on the knee , below the ankle or waist ) , that player is eliminated from the game . If a player hits themself with the ball below their own knee they are out .
A player may not hit the ball out of the pit . The penalty for breaking this rule is assigned to the last player to touch the ball before leaving the pit , rather than to the original hitter . Because this provision can result in a strategy of hitting the ball upwards to eliminate another player , the rule prohibiting scooping attempts to discourage this . In some versions , an exception is made if the ball hits a wall or the ground before leaving the pit ; in this scenario , the exit is deemed to be the result of a ricochet , and the player is not eliminated .
Holding or otherwise using the wall to assist a jump is termed `` spidering '' and is prohibited . However , some variations allow spidering .
No player may hit the ball twice in a row , unless the ball comes into contact with the wall or another player between touches . This rule is sometimes expanded to include `` self-serving , '' which prevents the player that served the ball from being the first to touch the ball .
If a player pops the ball up into the air , another player may catch it and ground it . The other player is then out , however most variations prohibit catching completely .
A player must step out of the pit completely to show that they have been eliminated .
A player must start the game with one of their hands ( or some versions feet ) touching the wall of the pit ; however , some versions do not make it a rule to touch the pit as the game starts . One player or a referee has to throw the ball in and have it bounce thrice and chant `` ga-ga-ball '' ( Some versions use `` ga-ga-go '' , `` ga-ga '' , and `` ga-ga-ga '' , among others ) . If a player removes their hand ( or foot ) off the wall before the second bounce , they are eliminated .
The winner of the last game has the right to serve to start the next game .
Other rules may be added as necessary , and some may choose to play without all of the above rules . Additional rules that vary in frequency of implementation include the prohibition of blocking ( using one 's hands as a barrier between the ball and one 's feet , rather than jumping ) , crouching , playing on the ground , and rolling . In other variations , an additional ball may enter play towards the end of the game if the two or three remaining players are making slow progress . Commonly , there will be a 20-second count down when play is too slow and only 2 or 3 players remain . At the end of the countdown , a new game is started .
Origin of the game
The origins of gaga have remained largely a mystery since its first appearance in the mid-20th century , though the predominant theory is that it was invented in Israel and exported to other countries around the world , usually as a game played by children at summer camps .
Australia
Competitive gaga was reportedly popular in the Australian Jewish communities of Perth , Western Australia , in the 1980s , primarily through the exchange of Israeli madrikhim ( counselors ) to Australia , or Australian madrikhim returning from Israel . Although those claims remain largely anecdotal , fans of the game often cite Australia as a country in which the gaga community was especially active .
North America
Gaga is most frequently said to have been brought to the United States by Israeli counselors working at Jewish summer camps , arriving in the northeastern region as early as the 1950s , then spreading nationwide over the ensuing decades .
Gaga in the modern day is frequently played at summer camps and on school playgrounds , as the means for a pit 's construction are typically less expensive than other games requiring structures ( i.e . steel soccer goals ) .
Mainstream gaga
In July 2012 , The New York Times wrote that , `` to the surprise of parents who recall the game from their youths , gaga is solidly mainstream . '' Among the things that contributed to gaga 's expansion , the article credits children 's love of the game . `` They are teaching it to their parents and not vice versa . It 's not like baseball or football or tennis , where they have to emulate someone else . Kids own it . ''
Gaga continued its U.S. expansion to Manhattan with the 2011 opening of The Gaga Center , New York 's first facility dedicated to the sport .
Tablet magazine investigation
In 2016 and 2017 , Tablet magazine reporter Stephen Silver wrote a two-part investigation of gaga 's origins , sifting through the various theories and rumors that had circulated over the preceding 60 years . In the second of the two articles , titled `` Is the Mystery of Ga-Ga , Everyone 's Favorite Summer-Camp Game , Finally Solved ? '' Silver interviewed a 61-year-old native of Baltimore , Maryland , Steve Steinberg , who claimed to have invented gaga in 1975 as a teenage camp counselor to six-year-old boys at Camp Milldale , a Jewish Community Center camp in the Baltimore area . `` [ Steinberg ] says he started the game for the same reason it 's still played today at countless summer camps , '' Silver wrote , `` to keep campers busy on rainy days . '' Contrary to the theory that the game 's name derives from the Hebrew word meaning `` touch-touch , '' Steinberg explained to Silver that during a moment of frustration with his campers , he 'd told them that they `` all look like a bunch of babies , '' and that the children responded by chanting `` goo-goo , ga-ga. '' Steinberg said that the game became very popular with his campers , and that he eventually shortened the name to `` ga-ga '' so that it would fit on the printed activity schedule . The Steinberg story has been repeated in many other magazines , journals and blogs across the country .
In popular culture
In the season 8 episode of Bob 's Burgers , `` Y Tu Ga-Ga Tambien '' , the students of Wagstaff become obsessed with gaga after it is introduced by guidance counsellor Mr. Frond . The game quickly takes over recess , becoming the only thing anyone wants to do or talk about . However , Gene feels that just because something is fun and popular does n't mean it should be the only thing you want to do , and that others should n't be afraid to dislike it or to want to do something else .

The Camminanti are a nomadic ethnic group living in Southern Italy , almost entirely in Sicily . They are closely associated with the Romani people , given their similar circumstances and lifestyles , and although they are not ethnic Romani , they are legally considered to be so by the European Union .
The European Union has repeatedly called for the human rights of Camminanti to be respected , as well as Italian Romani .
Distribution
The Camminanti live mainly in Sicily ( especially Val di Noto ) , however , there are smaller populations in Campania , Lombardy , and Lazio . They are a very small group , numbering about 2000 .
History
While it is agreed they came to Sicily during the 14th century , the exact origins of the Camminanti are unclear . One theory asserts that they are the descendants of Slavic and Nordic travellers , but this has been met with little consensus . Similar , but unproven , theories hypothesize that the people originated as the survivors of the 1693 Sicily earthquake or that they were initially slaves but transformed into an ethnic group after Slavery was abolished . There is still little evidence in support of these claims .
Culture
The Camminanti have their own language , called Baccagghiu , related to the Sicilian language and influenced by 16th century-era Greek travellers in Palermo .
In Italy they are well-known for their practice of making balloons , which serves as one of their main sources of income .
Gradually more and more Camminanti are switching to a more sedentary way of life ; however most of them are still nomadic .

In geometry , a dodecagram ( ) is a star polygon or compound with 12 vertices . There is one regular dodecagram polygon ( with Schläfli symbol and a turning number of 5 ) . There are also 4 regular compounds and
Regular dodecagram
There is one regular form : { 12/5 } , containing 12 vertices , with a turning number of 5 . A regular dodecagram has the same vertex arrangement as a regular dodecagon , which may be regarded as { 12/1 } .
Dodecagrams as regular compounds
There are four regular dodecagram star figures : { 12/2 } =2 { 6 } , { 12/3 } =3 { 4 } , { 12/4 } =4 { 3 } , and { 12/6 } =6 { 2 } . The first is a compound of two hexagons , the second is a compound of three squares , the third is a compound of four triangles , and the fourth is a compound of six straight-sided digons . The last two can be considered compounds of two compound hexagrams and the last as three compound tetragrams .
Dodecagrams as isotoxal figures
An isotoxal polygon has two vertices and one edge type within its symmetry class . There are 5 isotoxal dodecagram star with a degree of freedom of angles , which alternates vertices at two radii , one simple , 3 compounds , and 1 unicursal star .
Dodecagrams as isogonal figures
A regular dodecagram can be seen as a quasitruncated hexagon , t { 6/5 } = { 12/5 } . Other isogonal ( vertex-transitive ) variations with equally spaced vertices can be constructed with two edge lengths .
Complete graph
Superimposing all the dodecagons and dodecagrams on each other – including the degenerate compound of six digons ( line segments ) , { 12/6 } – produces the complete graph K12 .
Regular dodecagrams in polyhedra
Dodecagrams can also be incorporated into uniform polyhedra . Below are the three prismatic uniform polyhedra containing regular dodecagrams ( there are no other dodecagram-containing uniform polyhedra ) .
Dodecagrams can also be incorporated into star tessellations of the Euclidean plane .
Dodecagram Symbolism
Dodecagrams or twelve-pointed stars have been used as symbols for the following :
the twelve tribes of Israel , in Judaism
the twelve disciples , in Christianity
the twelve olympians , in Hellenic Polytheism
the twelve signs of the zodiac
the International Order of Twelve Knights and Daughters of Tabor , an African-American fraternal group
the fictional secret society Manus Sancti , in the Knights of Manus Sancti series by Bryn Donovan

A Polybiography is the use of archived internet email services such as ListServs and WWWeb to publish historical information by those involved in the history . The historical web site and ListServ provide for formal historical articles , images , photographs , commentary , and discussion of those items in a process called a `` polybiography '' ... the history by many of the many events . The site is designed to be a searchable repository of `` raw material '' for those with an interest in the history of Diagnostic Medical Sonography ( ultrasonography ) .
This Internet based historical archive has been referred to as a `` polybiography '' because it is both biographical and autobiographical ; the many individuals involved write the history of the many events discussed . The resulting archive is expected to be similar to an oral history where an editor records and transcribes the various stories into a cohesive narrative . However , the oral history will have a slant due to the selection of participants and how they are edited . The polybiography will avoid a bias or slant from an editor because the participants are self-selected . The stories will be in the unedited words of the individuals who made the history . The primary problem anticipated will be the differences in individuals ' writing styles , and a possibly confused organization .
The polybiography is uniquely adapted to the Internet and would be virtually impossible without the Internet . Without the global connections it would be difficult to locate all the individuals who contributed to the development of historical events . By the use of the Internet anyone who has a story to tell about the developments will be able to add to the history . This will allow those who were assistants to contribute , as well as the luminaries ; where as with the traditional oral history , the editor might not locate some relatively minor , relocated participants .
The concept of the `` polybiography '' was first presented at the Annual Conference 2000 of the American Association of History & Computing in Waco , Texas . The original article was titled `` Poly-autobiography of Diagnostic Medical Sonography '' , but during the discussion following the presentation it was suggested that , while the concept was thought to be a unique use of the Internet and WWWeb , the term `` polybiography '' would be more appropriate , more descriptive , and simpler .

Syarifah Nawawi ( 1896–1988 ) was an Indonesian activist and educationist . Nawawi worked to promote educational reform in the Dutch East Indies and later Indonesia , placing special emphasis on women 's and children 's education .
Biography
Nawawi was born in Bukittinggi , West Sumatra , then part of the Dutch East Indies . She was the daughter of Nawawi Soetan Makmoer , himself a strong advocate for educational reform in Sumatra . She was educated at the European-style Kweekschool in Bukittinggi , where her father worked as a teacher . She graduated in 1916 , and in doing so became one of the first Minangkabau woman to receive a western education . She moved to Battavia and worked as a teacher , eventually marrying Wiranatakusumah V. The couple had three children before Wiranatakusumah divorced Nawawi in 1924 , an act which caused a minor scandal ; Nawawi 's daughter , Mien Soedarpo ( 1924–2013 ) would become a prominent independence activist .
Nawawi returned to Bukittinggi after her divorce , living in the city and working as the headmistress of a girls ' school until the death of her parents in 1937 , after which she returned to Batavia . She had her children educated at the elite Koning Willem III School te Batavia . She also worked to reform women 's education in Jatinegara by forming an educational organization there . During World War II and the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies , she joined the Buddhist Women 's Association . In 1955 she joined PERWARI , a women 's rights movement that also participated in the Indonesian independence movement . She continued advocating for education until her death in 1988 .

The Grotta dello Smeraldo ( Italian for `` Emerald Grotto '' ) is a cave , partly inundated by the sea and located in Conca dei Marini , Italy , on the Amalfi Coast .
Overview
The cave owes its name due to the emerald light that reverberates in it : an underwater fissure allows sunlight to filter through . The grotto , located at the Amalfi Coast , is partly filled with seawater . The surface area of the water measures roughly 45 × 32 metres , with a cavern roof about 24 metres above water level . Formation of cave was caused by bradyseism ( tectonic upheaval of cliffs ) : cliffs fractured , and the cave was formed along the fissures . Now the cave has descended , and seawater had entered it , partly flooding the stalagmites in it .
Unlike the Blue Grotto , located a few kilometres to the west on Capri , the Grotta dello Smeraldo has no natural outlet above the waterline . The only opening to the outside world is just below the water level . Refracted sunlight entering the cavern through the opening gives the water its characteristic emerald glow during daylight hours .
The absence of a natural opening above the waterline meant that the grotto 's existence remained unknown for many years . It was discovered in 1932 by a fisherman named Luigi Buoncore .
The grotto is accessible from Strada Statale 163 , the main road along the Amalfi Coast . There is a small parking lot beside an elevator which takes visitors down to cave level , where they board boats that take them through the grotto .

Reeves Bluffs ( ) is a line of east-facing rock bluffs , 8 nautical miles ( 15 km ) long , situated 15 nautical miles ( 28 km ) west of Cape Murray in the Cook Mountains , Antarctica . Discovered by the Discovery expedition ( 1901–04 ) under Captain Robert F. Scott , who gave the name `` Mount Reeves , '' after Edward A. Reeves , Map Curator to the Royal Geographical Society , to a summit along this bluff . The bluff was mapped in detail by the United States Geological Survey ( USGS ) from surveys and U.S. Navy aerial photography ( 1959–63 ) . Since a prominent mountain does not rise from the bluffs , and because the name Mount Reeves is in use elsewhere in Antarctica , the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names ( US-ACAN ) ( 1965 ) recommended that the original name be amended and that the entire line of bluffs be designated as Reeves Bluffs .

A mixed mating system ( in plants ) , also known as “ variable inbreeding ” a characteristic of many hermaphroditic seed plants , where more than one means of mating is used . Mixed mating usually refers to the production of a mixture of self-fertilized ( selfed ) and outbred ( outcrossed ) seeds . Plant mating systems influence the distribution of genetic variation within and among populations , by affecting the propensity of individuals to self-fertilize or cross-fertilize ( or reproduce asexually ) . Mixed mating systems are generally characterized by the frequency of selfing vs. outcrossing , but may include the production of asexual seeds through agamospermy . The trade offs for each strategy depend on ecological conditions , pollinator abundance and herbivory and parasite load . Mating systems are not permanent within species ; they can vary with environmental factors , and through domestication when plants are bred for commercial agriculture .
Occurrence
Although practiced by a minority of species , mixed mating systems are widespread . Examples of mixed mating systems in nature are found in jewelweeds , violets , morning glories , and bamboos , which are considered invasive in many regions . Mixed mating is common in many invasive species . Part of their ability to spread vigorously is sometimes attributed to changes in mating strategies , potentially caused by varying environmental factors , including pollinator service . Common commercial crops , including peanut plant , avocados , sorghum , and cotton , also exhibit mixed mating systems .
Evolutionary models of mixed mating
Historically , Charles Darwin 's experiments on selfing and out-crossing many plant species caused him to question any adaptive value of self-fertilization . Early evolutionary models assumed inbreeding depression did not change , which increased the likelihood of stable mixed mating .
Ronald Fisher ( 1941 ) presented the idea that selfing plants had a genetic transmission advantage over outcrossing plants because selfed offspring would inherit two copies of the seed parent 's genome instead of just one . His models solidified the idea of automatic selection for increased selfing .
David Lloyd ( 1979 ) developed phenotypic models that showed that the conditions of automatic selection for selfing via pollinators was different from autonomous selfing , and predictive of stable mixed mating systems .
Lande & Schemske ( 1985 ) introduced the idea that inbreeding depression is not constant and evolves through purging of genetic load due to selection associated with selfing . They predicted that outcrossing as a mating strategy would resist increases in selfing frequencies due to inbreeding depression , but once inbreeding depression was reduced , selection due to the genetic transmission advantage would result in the production of only selfed seeds . Their model predicted that most plants would either be outcrossing or selfing . The observation of large numbers of species with mixed mating contradicted this idea , and motivated others to develop models to explain the prevalence of mixed mating systems including ideas such as selective interference and pollen discounting .
Mechanisms maintaining mixed mating systems
Mass Action Model – Holsinger 's “ mass action ” model assumes that the proportion of selfed and out-crossed seeds produced is a function of rates of pollen transfer among plants and plant density . This model predicts that mixed mating can be a stable strategy when plants receive mixtures of self and out-cross pollen .
Selective Interference –The genetic process of selective inference may prevent purging of genetic load and counterbalance the automatic selection of selfing .
Cryptic Self-Incompatibility – A mechanism of reproductive assurance , pollen competition favors out-cross pollen resulting in complete out-crossing when pollinators are abundant , but allows for self-fertilization when pollen is limited .
Delayed Selfing – A mechanism providing reproductive assurance at a lower cost than autonomous selfing , when the anthers or stigma change position as the flower ages , bringing them into close proximity and promoting self-pollination .
Reproductive Compensation – A result of more ovules than can mature into seeds , and the production of large numbers of seeds over the lifespan of a perennial plant , can contribute to the evolution of mixed mating systems . Rare selfed seedlings with higher fitness may decrease the fitness difference between selfed and out-crossed offspring .
Cleistogamy – Most plants producing cleistogamous ( closed , selfing ) flowers also produce chasmogamous ( open , outcrossing ) flowers , and consequently will typically produce mixtures of selfed and out-crossed seeds .
Components of the maintenance of mixed mating system also include self‐compatibility , especially autonomous self‐pollination , which can become particularly beneficial in human degraded habitats with fewer pollinators and increased pollen limitation .

Biography
Noda was from a wealthy farming family of Takata , Fukuoka ( currently part of the city of Miyama , Fukuoka Prefecture ) . In his youth , he worked in the Miike Coal Mines , following which he obtained a position at the Miike Bank , both owned by the Mitsui zaibatsu . He became active in politics , supporting the Freedom and People 's Rights Movement , serving in the Fukuoka Prefectural Assembly in 1886 . He was elected to the Lower House of the Diet of Japan in the March 1898 General Election , and was subsequently re-elected a total of nine times . As an entrepreneur , he founded the Miike Civil Engineering Company , and was one of the founding members of the South Manchurian Railway in 1906 . He was secretary-general of the Rikken Seiyūkai political party in 1912 , and became vice president of the Oriental Development Company in 1913 . While vice president of the Oriental Development Company , Noda advised the Diet that the number of Japanese agricultural emigrants to Korea would reach 500,000 by the year 1920 , however , the actual numbers eventually turned out to be only a small fraction of this number .
Noda served as Minister of Communications from 1918-1922 under the Hara and Takahashi administrations . He subsequently served as Minister of Commerce and Industry under the Katō Tomosaburō administration in 1925 .
Noda was also a poet , noted for the nationalistic themes in his works , and was a close correspondent with Tōyama Mitsuru and Nakano Seigō , with whom he cooperated in the creation of the Kokushikan University in 1917 .

Aitken House is a Canadian residence , historically was an all-male , until 2021 where it was reassigned as a co-ed residence ; located on the University of New Brunswick 's Fredericton campus . It was established in 1958 and has since been a prominent member of UNB 's residence community . The households many traditions such as their Club Med beach party , their house dance to the song `` Shout '' by the Isley Brothers , and their house cheer . Aitken House is the only residence at UNB to have their own alumni association , and has recently celebrated their 60th anniversary , which saw Aitken brothers from 1958-2018 attend .
History
Built in 1958 with funding provided by Maxwell Aitken A.K.A . Lord Beaverbrook , Aitken house was the second residence to be built on the UNB Fredericton campus .
In the winter of 2007 , UNB Residential Life & Conferencing Services decided that due to a lack of enrollment in residence , they would close Aitken House and attempt to sell it to the University to be turned into an academic building . Although the residence community had seen many buildings come and go throughout its lifetime , the residents and alumni of Aitken House were not ready to let it go without a fight . The majority of the residence community showed their support to keep Aitken House alive through painting red A 's in their windows , flying banners , and attending meetings . There were also those who supported ResLife 's position and the campus newspaper 's letters to the editor section was filled with controversy every week . Throughout the remainder of that academic year , the supporters of Aitken appealed at many meetings to stop the sale of the house . But to their dismay they were unable to stop it along the way . It progressed all the way through to the UNB Board of Governors ( BOG ) meeting , a step that is usually just a formality . Traditionally only the members of the BOG are allowed to be present during a meeting but they allowed the house to make a presentation as to why the residence building should be spared . As the members of the BOG entered the Wu Center for their meeting , they were greeted by Aitken House residents and supporters mainly from other residences at UNB , all lined up beside each entrance . The meeting went on for hours and everyone went to wait for the final word back at Aitken House . For the first time in UNB BOG 's history , a decision was overturned and the House was saved .
Sports
Aitken House always has a good showing at each sporting event , and often is number one among the other UNB residences .
Aitken House competes in many of UNB 's intramural athletics . Every year the house is found at such sporting events as :
Outdoor & Indoor Soccer ,
Softball & Co-Rec Softball ,
Flag football ,
Volleyball & Co-Rec Volleyball ,
Basketball ,
Water Polo ,
Ball Hockey & Ice Hockey ,
Co-Rec Ultimate Frisbee , and
Broom Ball .
Traditions
Aitken House is built on a number of traditions , that are passed down , year after year ; the men of Aitken uphold a number of these traditions with pride and passion . Some of the traditions include :
Club Med - 24 tons of sand is passed , bucket by bucket , into the basement , where a gigantic beach party takes place , every November .
Aitken Week - One week in January where the house celebrates its history , brotherhood , and alumni .

With a Little Help from My Friends is the debut album by singer-songwriter Joe Cocker , released in late April 1969 . It was certified gold in the US and peaked at number 35 on the Billboard 200 . In the UK , the album charted in May 1972 at number 29 when it was re-released as a double pack with Cocker 's second LP Joe Cocker ! .
The title track was written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney and originally performed by the Beatles on the album Sgt . Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band ; it has been inducted into both the Grammy Award Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame . Cocker 's version was the theme song to the television series The Wonder Years during the 1980s and 1990s .
In 2015 , the Audio Fidelity company released a limited reissue of the album in hybrid SACD format as a tribute to Cocker .
Reception
With a Little Help from My Friends met with a favourable review from Rolling Stone '' 's John Mendelsohn . Mendelsohn stated that `` Cocker has assimilated the [ Ray ] Charles influence to the point where his feeling for what he is singing can not really be questioned . And , in answer to the question of why someone should listen to Cocker when there is Charles to listen to – how many times in recent years has the latter applied himself to such exceptional modern material [ ... ] or such contemporary Dylan ... ? '' He also stated that `` Cordell 's success in fusing a consistently marvelous backing unit out of America 's premier studio soul singers and England 's most famous rock musicians and delicate egos can not be exaggerated . '' He concluded that `` it 's a triumph all around . And the thought of Cocker 's next album [ ... ] is an exceptionally pleasant one . '' In The New York Times '' , Robert Christgau wrote :
A retrospective review from Allmusic 's Bruce Eder was fairly positive . Eder stated that the album `` holds up extraordinarily well across four decades , the singer 's performance bolstered by some very sharp playing , [ ... ] It 's Cocker 's voice , a soulful rasp of an instrument [ ... ] that carries this album and makes `` Change in Louise , '' `` Feeling Alright , '' `` Just Like a Woman , '' `` I Shall Be Released , '' and even `` Bye Bye Blackbird '' into profound listening experiences . '' He concluded that `` the surprises in the arrangements , tempo , and approaches taken help make this an exceptional album . Tracks like `` Just Like a Woman , '' with its soaring gospel organ above a lean textured acoustic and light electric accompaniment , and the guitar-dominated rendition of `` Do n't Let Me Be Misunderstood '' [ ... ] all help make this an exceptional listening experience . ''

`` We Are One ( Ole Ola ) '' is a song recorded by Cuban-American rapper Pitbull for One Love , One Rhythm – The 2014 FIFA World Cup Official Album ( 2014 ) . It is the official song of the 2014 FIFA World Cup and features guest vocals from American singer Jennifer Lopez and Brazilian singer Claudia Leitte . The artists co-wrote the song with Sia , RedOne , Danny Mercer , Dr. Luke , Cirkut , and Thomas Troelsen ; the latter three are also the producers .
While receiving positive reviews from critics , initially the song received some negative reactions from Brazilians over its lack of Brazilian feeling . To change that , another version was also released and the music changed slightly to fit Afro Brazilian group Olodum 's style of drumming – that version being the one that was used in the music video for the song . `` We Are One '' has experienced commercial success , reaching the top 20 in countries including Austria , France , Germany , Italy , Spain , and World Cup 's host country , Brazil . The song peaked at number one in three countries .
Background and release
According to one of the co-writers of `` We Are One ( Ole Ola ) , Thomas Troelsen , he pitched a demo version `` that had a sort of whistle thing in it '' to Pitbull . On January 22 , 2014 , FIFA and Sony Music Entertainment announced that `` We Are One ( Ole Ola ) '' would serve as the official song of the 2014 FIFA World Cup . At the occasion , Pitbull said , `` I 'm honored to join Jennifer Lopez and Claudia Leitte at the FIFA World Cup to bring the world together . I truly believe that this great game and the power of music will help unify us because we are best when we are one . '' Lopez said Pitbull asked her to join the song : `` I ca n't take credit for this . This was one of Pitbull 's call-ins . He had this record , and he 's like , ' I think this record could be great for the World Cup . He 's like , 'Will you do it with me ? ' And I go , 'Yeah , of course . ' '' A solo version of the song featuring only Pitbull leaked online on February 2 . On April 8 , Pitbull tweeted an iTunes Store link to the track , debuting the song .
Critical response
The song received generally lukewarm reviews . Carl Williott of Idolator opined that there is too much of Pitbull in the song , and not enough Lopez or Leitte . He , however , stated that the song is an upgrade from Shakira 's `` Waka Waka ( This Time for Africa ) '' , the official song of the 2010 FIFA World Cup . Fuse.tv wrote that , similarly to `` Waka Waka '' , the song `` blends the feel of the tournament 's hosting country with an accessible , exciting pop sound that has instant repeat appeal '' . Judy Cantor-Navas of Billboard described the song as `` surprisingly breezy '' , with Spin noting it to contain the `` rah-rah international unity you 'd expect for a Cup song '' . Luís Antônio Giron of Época criticized the album saying `` maybe I 'm wrong and Brazil only crave to be the same as what FIFA wants it to be . Brazil is fifalized '' . And praised music produced in Miami , `` bomb on any track . ''
The song received some criticism from Brazilian and football fans over its tone and lyrics , particularly with the lyrics and video being labeled as a `` big pile of clichés '' and its failure to pay homage to Brazil 's own rich musical heritage . Such criticism has pointed out the small amount of actual Portuguese lyrics involved , and critics stating their confusion to why `` were Cuban-American rapper Pitbull and Bronx-born Puerto Rican singer Jennifer Lopez were chosen for the song , when there are so many other great musicians in the land of bossa nova '' , as well as its `` reinforcement of stereotypes with smiling , barefoot children and semi-naked , samba-dancing women '' .
Music video
In February 2014 , Pitbull , Leitte and Lopez shot the music video for `` We Are One ( Ole Ola ) '' with Olodum in Fort Lauderdale , Florida , United States . Its concept was to simulate Carnival in its home country Brazil with the Olodum mix of the song being used as the soundtrack . It was released on May 16 , 2014 . As of May 2022 , the video has received over 820 million views .
Live performances
Pitbull , Lopez and Leitte performed `` We Are One ( Ole Ola ) '' at the 2014 Billboard Music Awards on May 18 , 2014 . They also performed the song at the 2014 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony on June 12 in Arena Corinthians , São Paulo , prior to the Brazil v. Croatia match , preceded by Leitte 's solo rendition of Ary Barroso 's classic `` Aquarela do Brasil '' . However , due to the amount of noise made by dancers and poor quality stadium acoustics , some spectators had difficulty hearing the vocals .

North Rockhampton Borough Chambers is a heritage-listed former town hall at 20 Bridge Street , Berserker , Rockhampton , Rockhampton Region , Queensland , Australia . It was designed by John William Wilson and built in 1885 by Messrs Burton and Smith . It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 27 September 2002 .
History
The North Rockhampton Borough Chambers was constructed in 1885 by Messrs Burton and Smith to a design by Rockhampton architect , JW Wilson . The borough council remained in the building until 1919 when the Town of North Rockhampton was absorbed into the Town of Rockhampton . Since 1919 , the building has been used by a number of groups , and from 1985 , has been the home of the Rockhampton and District Historical Society .
Rockhampton emerged as an important Queensland regional centre during the 1850s and 1860s . The Municipality of Rockhampton was proclaimed on 15 December 1860 . Rockhampton 's development took on a greater prominence after the discovery of the mining wealth at Mount Morgan in 1882 .
Rockhampton 's first neighbour in local government was the Gogango Divisional Board which was proclaimed by Order-in-Council in 1879 . It completely surrounded the Municipality of Rockhampton and included North Rockhampton . The Borough of North Rockhampton , with a population of less than 1700 , was established in 1883 , only two years after the opening of the first bridge across the Fitzroy River . Its thirty-six year existence was often difficult and unhappy . The borough had only a small population and its location across the river from the stronger and wealthier Rockhampton Municipality made negative comparisons inevitable and the development of its own identity almost impossible . Even at the end of its independent existence in 1919 , it was described as a `` small and straggling hamlet '' .
From the beginning great pressure appears to have been placed on the Mayors of the Council who were at loggerheads with their own councillors . In the last years of the borough 's existence , bitter letters of complaint to the Home Secretary or petitions demanding the removal of mayors and councillors went to Brisbane on a number of occasions .
The first meeting of resident landowners at North Rockhampton to receive nominations for councillors was held at the Forester 's Hall in October 1883 and the first council met in early December to fulfil initial civic commitments , though according to The Morning Bulletin , not in a `` very expeditious way '' . It was further commented in The Morning Bulletin that councillors should attend some meetings of the Rockhampton Municipality to learn procedure . The first mayor of the North Rockhampton Borough Council was William Hopkins . In February 1884 , however , he was replaced by the newly elected , John William Face .
The borough 's most pressing , and recurring problem was how to obtain a good water supply and the first three suggestions were a well , a pump near Kalka Creek and a dam in the Berserker Range . The council opted for a well in Kalka Creek near the foot of the Berserker Ranges and a pump to draw the water . The borough was still trying to raise funds for a dam in the Ranges when it became part of Greater Rockhampton in 1919 . Besides the water issue , the borough was concerned that , with the altering of divisional boundaries , it might lose the Lakes Creek area . Again , The Morning Bulletin saw fit to provide advice to borough by suggesting that the `` infant community '' should consider what an undue influence the Meat Preserving Company would have on its affairs , and thought that the borough would be better off without it . This is interesting as , it is likely that the municipality would have been strengthened by the establishment and continued presence of large industry .
In 1884 , new plans for a tramway were put forward when the Rockhampton and Northside Tramway Company pushed ahead with plans for construction . In early 1885 however , Railway Engineer , Robert Ballard , criticised the council for the dangerous state of the main thoroughfare ( Yaamba Road ) torn up for the tramway . By March 1885 , it was apparent that a tramway north or south of the river would not be completed .
Despite these difficulties , the North Rockhampton Borough Council obtained a loan to construct a purpose-built council building . The building was designed by John William Wilson and constructed by Messrs Burton and Smith at a cost of .
JW Wilson ( 1829-1915 ) was born in Banff , Scotland and emigrated to Australia , working in Ballarat as a foreman for the Victorian Works Department . After moving to Rockhampton in , Wilson worked as a builder and carrier until November 1874 when he began practice as an architect and surveyor , filling a void left by AW Voysey 's appointment to the railways . Wilson was seen as a practical architect and dominated the profession in Rockhampton until the 1890s .
The Northern Daily Argus on 17 December 1885 , reported that the North Rockhampton Municipal Chambers were rapidly approaching completion . The Argus advised that on entering the interior , the first object that meets the eye was the substantial strong room situated in the south-east corner of the hall , built of brick in cement and plastered over with three quarters cement . Messrs Wiley , Holmes and Company supplied the four large cedar folding doors as well as the four , circular , wooden ventilators in the ceiling . By December 1885 , partitions for four offices were in the course of assembly and the verandahs surrounding the premises were being covered by the plumbers with curved galvanised iron ( described in the newspaper as O.G . sheeting ) .
The North Rockhampton Borough Chambers survived the 1880s without too many crises or achievements ; however , in 1890 , the Town Clerk was arrested for embezzlement . Relationships between the borough and the Gogango Divisional Board became an issue once again in 1893 concerning the issue of the two main roads north of Rockhampton : the Yaamba Road and the Black Ball Flats ( now Norman Road ) . Letters of complaint and accusation were passed between the two local authorities and the Colonial Secretary . Maintenance of the roads were key issues .
Throughout the first decade of the 20th century , the North Rockhampton Borough Council was beset by other problems , including the entry of Labor politicians into the Council which alarmed the anti-socialist sector ; personal accusations from one councillor to another , in one instance , a councillor claiming that one of the candidates for council was a `` traitor '' and another councillor claiming that his questions to council had not been recorded in the minutes of the meeting .
A major change occurred in council structure and administration shortly after the First World War - the establishment of the Greater Rockhampton Scheme . When in 1918 , the North Rockhampton Borough Council approached Queensland Treasurer , Ted Theodore , for a loan , he considered it unfortunate that the government should be asked to finance two water schemes of considerable dimensions for the one city . The two local authorities were requested to work together for the one scheme . This was not easy as proposals for Greater Rockhampton had been turned down on two earlier occasions either through apathy or `` mere prejudice '' and it seemed that if Rockhampton wanted modern amenities these deterrent factors must be overcome . In the end it was government pressure rather than local agreement which brought amalgamation about and , in March 1919 , there were thirty-two nominations for the first enlarged council of eleven councillors .
Following the subsuming of the North Rockhampton Borough Council into the Greater Rockhampton Scheme , the Main Roads Board used the building as its offices from the 1920s to the 1960s , when it moved to new government offices in Bolsover Street . The Naval Cadets then made it their Headquarters before moving to another venue .
The Rockhampton City Council commenced restoration work on the building in 1984 . Since 1985 , the former North Rockhampton Borough Chambers has been the home of the Rockhampton and District Historical Society .

Cao Shen or Cao Can ( died 190 BC ) , courtesy name Jingbo ( ) , was a chancellor of the Western Han dynasty . He participated in the Chu–Han Contention on Liu Bang ( Emperor Gaozu of Han ) 's side and contributed greatly to the founding of the Han dynasty .
Early life
Cao Shen was from Pei County in present-day Jiangsu and he served as a prison warden in his early days . He was a close friend of Liu Bang . Once , Liu Bang was tasked with escorting some convicts to Mount Li to become labourers , but some prisoners escaped and Liu was forced to become a fugitive . He sought refuge with his followers on Mount Mangdang ( in present-day Yongcheng , Henan ) and maintained secret contact with Cao Shen and Xiao He . In 209 BC , after the Dazexiang Uprising broke out , the magistrate of Pei County considered rebelling against the Qin dynasty as well , so he heeded Cao Shen and Xiao He 's advice to invite Liu Bang back to support him . However , the magistrate changed his mind later and denied Liu Bang entry into the city . He was worried that Xiao He and Cao Shen might open the city gates for Liu Bang so he planned to have them killed , but Xiao and Cao managed to escape and join Liu . The townsfolk rebelled against the magistrate and killed him and allowed Liu Bang and his men to enter . Liu Bang built up his rebel army in Pei County and Cao Shen served as one of his advisors .
Insurrection against the Qin dynasty
Cao Shen defeated the Qin armies led by Xue Guo , Hu Ling and Fang Yu , and was promoted to a high rank by Liu Bang for his contributions . Cao Shen defeated Zhang Han 's army and drove Zhang towards Puyang . He returned to help Liu Bang , who was trapped at Yongqiu , and defeated Li You , the Qin general defending Sanchuan . By then , Cao Shen had conquered two fiefs and 122 counties in total . In the following battles against Qin , Cao Shen defeated the Qin generals Wang Li and Zhao Ben and captured the Wu and Yao passes leading to Xianyang ( the Qin capital ) .
Chu–Han Contention
After the fall of the Qin dynasty , Liu Bang received the title of `` King of Han '' from Xiang Yu , and was relocated to Hanzhong . Liu Bang granted Cao Shen the title of `` Marquis of Jiancheng '' ( ) and promoted him to a general rank . Cao Shen helped Liu Bang conquer the Three Qins . During the Chu–Han Contention , a power struggle between Liu Bang and Xiang Yu , Cao Shen joined Han Xin 's army in the campaigns on the northern front . They scored victories against Wei Bao 's forces , the Zhao army at the Battle of Jingxing , and the combined forces of Qi and Chu at the Battle of Wei River . During this time , Cao Shen was appointed as acting-Left Chancellor of Liu Bang 's Han kingdom , and subsequently promoted to Right Chancellor . After the conquest of the Qi kingdom , Cao Shen left Han Xin and returned to Liu Bang 's side to join him in resisting Xiang Yu . Liu Bang later sent Cao Shen to suppress the remnants of Qi .
In 202 BC , Liu Bang defeated Xiang Yu at the Battle of Gaixia and unified China under his rule . Liu Bang became the Emperor and his dynasty was named `` Han '' . He was historically known as `` Emperor Gao '' ( or Emperor Gaozu ) . When rewarding his subjects , Gaozu named Cao Shen as the person who made the most contributions in battle . However , Cao Shen resigned from his post as Right Chancellor . In 201 BC , Cao Shen was appointed as chancellor of Qi Kingdom , which was then ruled by Liu Fei ( Gaozu 's eldest son ) . He was also conferred the title of `` Marquis of Pingyang '' ( ) and given 10,630 households in his marquisate .
As chancellor
While serving as chancellor , Cao Shen sought the help of Confucian scholars in governing Qi but was not impressed by their ideas . After discussing with a scholar called Gai Gong , Cao Shen was influenced by the Huang-Lao ( ) school of thought , which used a mix of persuasion and coercion . Cao Shen followed Gai Gong 's advice to implement policies to restore social stability and frequently consulted Gai Gong on how to govern Qi .
In 196BC , he commanded the Qi forces that assisted the emperor in suppressing Chen Xi 's rebellion in Dai ( present-day northern Shanxi and northwestern Hebei ) .
In 193 BC , the chancellor Xiao He died and was succeeded by Cao Shen . Cao Shen spent his time drinking and feasting , and maintained well Xiao He 's system of governance but did not implement any new changes . When Emperor Hui asked him why he did not change the system , Cao Shen replied that he was not as good as Xiao He and did not want to make changes for fear of negatively affecting the system left behind by Xiao . This became the origin of a Chinese idiom , Xiao Gui Cao Sui ( 萧规曹随 ; lit . `` Cao following Xiao 's rules '' ) , which is used to describe the continuation of the work of one 's predecessor .
Appraisal
The historian Sima Qian commented in Records of the Grand Historian that he felt that among all of Liu Bang 's subjects , Cao Shen 's contributions in battle was second only to Han Xin . Commenting on Cao Shen 's role as chancellor , Sima Qian mentioned that Cao had done well in preserving Xiao He 's system of governance and achieved the peace and stability desired by the people .
Family and descendants
Cao Shen 's son , Cao Zhu ( 曹窋 ; died 161 BC ) , inherited his father 's marquis title `` Marquis of Pingyang '' . Cao Zhu was in turn succeeded by his son , Cao Qi ( 曹奇 ; died 153 BC ) , who helped Emperor Jing suppresses the Rebellion of the Seven States . Cao Qi 's son , Cao Shi ( 曹時 ; died 131 BC ) , married Princess Pingyang , one of Emperor Jing 's daughters . Cao Shi 's son , Cao Xiang ( 曹襄 ; died 115 BC ) , married Princess Wei ( a daughter of Emperor Wu and Empress Wei Zifu ) and served as a general in the Han campaigns against the Xiongnu . Cao Xiang 's son , Cao Zong ( 曹宗 ; died 91 BC ) , was implicated in a plot to overthrow Emperor Wu in 91 BC and was stripped of the marquis title he inherited from his ancestor . He and his family also lost their inherited marquisate as a consequence .
Three Kingdoms warlord Cao Cao claimed to be a descendant of Cao Shen . However this has been rebuked through genetic evidence .

Gümüshtekin , also known as Gumushtekin ( died in 1177 ) , was an eunuch who held high offices in the Zengids ' empire . Nur ad-Din , of Aleppo , appointed him to be his lieutenant in Mosul in Iraq . After Nur ad-Din died in 1174 , Gümüshtekin assumed the guardianship for Nur ad-Din 's underage son , as-Salih Ismail al-Malik and took his ward from Damascus to Aleppo . He made an alliance with as-Salih 's cousin Sayf al-Din Ghazi II of Mosul against Ibn al-Muqaddam who had taken control of Damascus . Ibn al-Muqaddam sought assistance from the Ayubbid ruler of Egypt , Saladin , and surrendered the city to him . As-Salih granted Harem in to him .

Alltddu Halt railway station served the hamlet of Allt-ddu , located between Lampeter and Aberystwyth on the Carmarthen Aberystwyth Line in the Welsh county of Ceredigion . The Ystwyth Trail , a multi-use rail trail , now passes the site on the trackbed of the former railway .
History
Opened by the Great Western Railway , the station passed on to British Railways on nationalisation in 1948 . It was then closed by the British Railways Board . Although proposed for closure in the Beeching Report serious damage due to flooding south of Aberystwyth closed that section in December 1964 . The cost of repairs was deemed unjustified and led to the withdrawal of passenger services in February 1965 , however milk trains continued to run from Carmarthen to nearby Pont Llanio until 1970 .

Jorge Novak ( 4 March 1928 - 9 July 2001 ) was an Argentine Roman Catholic prelate and professed member from the Divine Word Missionaries who served as the Bishop of Quilmes from 1976 until his death . He is best known for his staunch defense of human rights and critical statements regarding the position of the Church during the period of the Argentine dictatorship during the 1970s . He was also known for his promotion of proper economic management when the nation 's economic fortunes dwindled and promoted jobs and strong action for the poor and neglected .
The cause for Novak 's beatification started on 19 August 2017 ; he is titled now as a Servant of God .
Life
Jorge Novak was born on 4 March 1928 to Jorge Novak and Christina Prediger ; he was of the Volga German descent . He had seven brothers .
Novak entered the Divine Word Missionaries and made his initial profession on 1 March 1947 and on 1 March 1953 made his solemn profession into the order . He was ordained to the priesthood in 1954 in Bahía Blanca and in 1958 obtained a doctorate in historical sciences from the Pontifical Gregorian in Rome .
In 1972 he became the provincial superior for the order and held that appointment until his elevation to the episcopate . Pope Paul VI later created the Quilmes diocese through the papal bull Cups Regimini on 2 August 1976 and appointed Novak as its first bishop on 7 August . Novak received his episcopal consecration on 19 September from Pio Laghi in the new diocese 's Immaculate Conception cathedral . There was initial apprehension surrounding his episcopal appointment due to strong rumors of his authoritative professorship in La Plata .
Novak railed against human rights abuses and criticized the dictatorship and the guerillas for their violence and carnage during the period of civil unrest and conflict . He pleaded for proper negotiations and peace in 1982 during the Falklands War . It was after the disappearances of 30,000 people became public that he served as a sort of 'spokesman ' for their next of kin asking for investigations and closure for the families of those lost .
He co-founded the Ecumenical Movement for Human Rights alongside several others in February 1976 . In September 1984 he was on a trip in Costa Rica when he was struck with Guillain-Barré and was recuperating to recover his motor skills until 1985 .
Towards the end of his life he wrote to the government demanding greater action for the poor and often used strong language in order to force the point across . He was also seen leading demonstrations for jobs and organized soup kitchens in shanties around urban centers . In 2000 he encouraged one of his priests and the prominent social worker Luis Farinello to go into politics to run for a Senate seat in the October congressional elections . Novak issued a decree that authorized Farinello to pursue politics but removed him from all ecclesial responsibilities from his public announcement of his candidature and for the duration of his mandate if elected . The decree cited canon 904 of canon law which allowed Farinello to `` celebrate Mass without the attendance of faithful '' and exhorted Farinello to adhere to the values of the Gospel and the social teachings of the Church .
On 28 April 1995 he issued a statement asking for forgiveness for the failure of the Argentine priesthood and episcopate to act during the 1970s when people were disappearing and being killed . Novak pleaded for forgiveness `` for our insensitivities '' while also referring to their collective `` cowardice '' and `` omissions '' which he affirmed made them complicit in the actions of the dictatorship . Back in 1991 he was a sharp critic of President Carlos Saul Menem for his decision to pardon Jorge Videla and other jailed leaders of the dictatorship and referred to the pardon as a `` humiliating defeat '' for those who suffered during the dictatorship . In June 2001 he gave his last sermon and discussed the growing economic crisis in which he asked : `` How is it possible that in this day and age there are still people who die from hunger , condemned to illiteracy , and without a roof over their heads ? ''
Novak had an operation for stomach cancer ( the disease he kept a close secret ) and later died from it at 4:00am on 9 July 2001 . Twelve bishops attended his funeral as did the apostolic nuncio ( later cardinal ) Santos Abril y Castelló ; the people shouted `` Viva el Padre Jorge '' and `` Viva Monsignor Novak '' as his casket was carried out of the church .
Beatification process
The cause commenced on 19 August 2017 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints declared `` nihil obstat '' ( no objections ) and titled Novak as a Servant of God . The diocesan process is set to open on 11 December 2017 .
From 24 June 2016 the postulator of the cause is the current Archbishop of Mendoza Marcelo Daniel Colombo .

Eric Boon ( 28 December 1919 – 19 January 1981 ) was a champion British lightweight boxer . Born in Chatteris , Cambridgeshire , he was known by the nicknames Boy Boon and the Fen Tiger . Of a total of 119 fights , he won 92 ( KO 62 ) , lost 21 ( KO 13 ) and drew 5 .
He beat Dave Crowley on 15 December 1938 to become British Lightweight Champion , a title he held for three years until 12 August 1944 . His match against Arthur Danahar from the Harringay Arena was the first televised boxing match , broadcast on BBC television and shown live in several cinemas on 23 February 1939 .
Boon v Danaher was the first occasion that the BBC had been permitted to televise a boxing match but also the first time a transmission had been shown live to a paying audience in cinemas ( the Marble Arch Pavilion and the Tatler News Theatre ) . This was achieved on Baird projection equipment using a 16-inch projection tube running at 45,000 volts , producing light levels comparable to that of normal films . Each projection unit contained two projection tubes , one acting as a backup in case the first one failed . This preceded the first televised heavyweight boxing match ( Max Baer vs Lou Nova , from Yankee Stadium ) which was held on 1 June 1939 .
Boon married Wendy Elliot in 1940 and , following his retirement from the sport , played a number of small roles in British films such as Champagne Charlie and Carry On Sergeant .

Three months after being installed he became an independent member . In the 2015 general election Rabbé ran once more for the National List , this time as the number two of the Renewed Democratic Liberty ( LIDER ) .
As member of the Guatemalan Republic Front ( FRG ) Rabbé unsuccessfully ran for the office of mayor of Guatemala City in 1999 . He subsequently served as Minister of Communications in the government of Alfonso Portillo between 2000 and 2001 . In the 2007 presidential election Rabbé was an unsuccessful candidate for the FRG .
Career and media
Rabbé was born on 26 May 1956 .
Rabbé had a career in media . He was president of , director of Radio Sonaro and later of Noti 7 . Rabbé has also been an investor and director of the magazine Proceso .
Political career
In 1999 Rabbé started his political career . In the 1999 general elections he ran for the position of mayor of Guatemala City for the Guatemalan Republic Front ( FRG ) . He lost against Fritz García Gallont .
In the same 1999 general elections Alfonso Portillo was elected president . Rabbé served in his government as Minister of Communication between January 2000 and June 2001 . Rabbé was a presidential candidate for the FRG in the 2007 elections , he obtained 7,29 % of the vote in the first round and was eliminated from the race .
The contacts Rabbé build up during his time as Minister gave him the opportunity to successfully run for Congress in the 2011 elections under the banner of National Change Union of Mario Estrada . Estrada had also served in the government of Portillo . Three months after being installed as Deputy Rabbé resigned from the National Change Union and became an independent member of Congress . He is a Deputy for the National List .
Rabbé ran for the office of President of the Congress in 2013 , but saw his attempt fail due to lack of support of Roberto Alejos and his party To-dos . On 30 October 2014 was elected as President of the Congress , he was elected at the same time as the other members of the governing council . The group received 85 votes in favor and took office on 14 January 2015 . Large parts of the opposition were absent during the vote . The group received support from the Patriotic Party and National Unity of Hope . As President , Rabbé succeeded Arístides Crespo , who was elected first vice-president .
In the 2015 general election Rabbé ran once more for the National List , this time as the number two of the Renewed Democratic Liberty ( LIDER ) list .
Rabbé 's term as President of the Congress ended on 14 January 2016 , he was succeeded by Mario Taracena . In April 2016 Rabbé switched parties to Alianza Ciudadana , becoming the last deputy to be allowed to do so in the term of Congress .
In 2016 Rabbé became target of investigation in the plazas fantasmas scandal involving members of Congress . The investigation was led by the public prosecution service and the Comisión Internacional contra la Impunidad en Guatemala . Rabbé and Arístides Crespo were seen as leaders of a group of seven deputies involved in abuse of power , misuse of state money and illegally appointing people to positions in government . Rabbé claimed immunity on charges against him . The however lifted his immunity in August 2016 . In August Rabbé wrote a letter to Congress President Mario Taracena asking him to allow him to be absent from the Congress for a one-month period . He stated to wish to have some personal meetings abroad in relation to the charges against him . Rabbé meanwhile flew to Mexico City . On 5 September an arrest warrant for Rabbé was made public . On 22 September Rabbé lost his seat in the Congress and was temporarily replaced by Fernando García Gudiel .
Personal life
Rabbé 's brother Alfredo is a politician as well . Like his brother he was elected to Congress in 2011 for the National Change Union and left the party at the same time to continue as independent .
Luis Rabbé is brother-in-law to Mexican media entrepreneur Remigio Ángel González . González donated $ 2.6 million to the 1999 Presidential campaign of Alfonso Portillo . After becoming President , Portillo named Rabbé Minister of Communication .

Clifton Hawkins ( born November 24 , 1981 ) is an American former professional basketball player . He started his high school career at Potomac High School in Dumfries , Virginia and transferred to Oak Hill Academy in Mouth of Wilson in his junior year , winning the Virginia Mr. Basketball award in his senior season in 2000 . He then signed to play college basketball at Kentucky , where he stayed 4 years , advancing to the NCAA tournament Sweet Sixteen in 2001 and 2002 and to the Elite Eight in 2003 . In 2004 , his senior year at Kentucky , he was an all-conference selection . After going undrafted in the 2004 NBA draft Hawkins started his professional career in Italy with LegaDue team JuveCaserta . He has played in Italy , France , Croatia , Turkey , Japan , Poland , Cyprus and Georgia in his 8-year professional career .
High school career
Hawkins was born in Alexandria , Virginia to Ricky Hunter and Monique Wilhite . A left-handed guard , he attended Potomac High School in Dumfries , where he was named in the Virginia All-AAA Second Team by the Washington Post . Hawkins ' sophomore year saw him averaging 19.3 points , 4.3 rebounds and 4.2 steals per game , shooting 58 % from the field , and was named in the All-Met team selected by the Washington Post , the first sophomore to receive a selection in an All-Met team . In the state semifinal against Hampton High School , Hawkins scored 31 points , and on the defensive side held All-American Ronald Curry to 6 points . Potomac reached the championship game , where they were defeated by George Washington High School of Danville . The Washington Post defined Hawkins the state 's top sophomore , and he was a first-team Class AAA All-State selection .
In July 1998 , the summer before his junior year , Hawkins participated in the ABCD Camp , a camp for the best high school players in the United States . Hawkins decided to transfer to Oak Hill Academy in Mouth of Wilson for his junior year ; Oak Hill coach Steve Smith praised his all-around playing style , and particularly his on-ball defense skills . In his first season with the Warriors , he was the only non-senior player to be in the starting lineup , playing at shooting guard ; he averaged 11.7 points , 2.3 rebounds , 5.4 assists and 3.9 steals ( the best mark in the country ) , shooting 50 % from thie field ( 30 % from three ) and 62.5 % from the free throw line . He established a new Oak Hill record for steals in a single season with 120 . In July 1999 Hawkins participated in the ABCD Camp for the second time in his career . Coach Smith moved Hawkins to point guard for his senior year , and Hawkins averaged a double double with 10.1 points and 12.5 assists per game : his 400 total assists were a new record for Oak Hill , as were his 167 steals ( 5.4 per game ) , which surpassed his own record of 120 established in the previous season . He also averaged 3.6 rebounds and shot 48 % from the field and 66.7 % from the free throw line . At the end of the season , Hawkins was named Oak Hill 's Most Valuable Player and was named Virginia Mr. Basketball by the Roanoke Times .
Hawkins was one of the top players in the country as a senior ; scout Bob Gibbons compared him to Kentucky guard Wayne Turner , and he was ranked in the top 50 by several recruiting services . He was the 36th best player overall according to the Recruiting Services Consensus Index ( RSCI ) , while Hoop Scoop ranked him 84th .
College career
Hawkins was recruited by many NCAA Division I schools : he had originally committed to play at New Mexico , but later signed with Kentucky in mid-November 1999 , knowing that the program needed a point guard after the graduation of Wayne Turner . Hawkins decided to wear jersey number 1 for the Wildcats , and played 33 out of 34 possible games in his freshman year ( 11 minutes per game ) , being used as a reserve by head coach Tubby Smith . Hawkins scored his first points on November 21 , 2000 against Jacksonville State , and also recorded 4 steals in 15 minutes in that game . He scored a season-high 11 points against North Carolina on December 2 , 2000 , and he had 7 assists against LSU on February 21 , 2001 . In the 2001 NCAA tournament Hawkins and the Wildcats reached the Sweet Sixteen , where they were eliminated by USC .
In his sophomore year , Hawkins saw increased playing time when coach Smith promoted him to a starting role . He started his first game against Western Kentucky on November 15 , 2001 , and December 18 , 2001 he scored 15 points against Duke in an overtime loss ; on December 22 he scored a career high 17 points against Indiana . On January 5 , 2002 he recorded a career high in assists with 10 against Mississippi State , and one week later he scored a game winner against South Carolina . In the 2002 NCAA tournament Hawkins started all the games and averaged 6.3 points , 4.3 rebounds and 4.7 assists : the Wildcats were eliminated by Maryland in the Sweet Sixteen .
Hawkins had academic issues at the beginning of his junior year , and missed the first 7 games ; he also lost his starting role in the lineup , and only started 1 game out of 29 appearances . Coach Smith used Hawkins as a sixth man and the guard had his best year in shooting , posting career highs in three-point field goal percentage ( 38.1 % ) and free throw percentage ( 74.7 % ) . Hawkins reappeared on the court on December 21 against Indiana after missing the first games of the year , and scored 4 points and had 5 rebounds and 5 assists in 26 minutes of play . He then scored 14 points ( a season high ) on February 23 , 2003 against Mississippi State , and he posted 9 assists in the SEC Tournament win against Vanderbilt . In the 2003 NCAA tournament Hawkins debuted with 13 points and 6 assists in 22 minutes against IUPUI ( 2/3 from the three-point line ) , followed by another 13-point performance against Utah . He then scored 4 points ( with 4 steals ) against Wisconsin , and in the loss against Marquette he had 9 points , 2 rebounds and 3 assists in 27 minutes . At the end of the season he was an Honorable mention AP All-SEC selection , and he led his team in assists ( 3.8 ) and steals per game ( 1.4 ) .
Hawkins gained back his starting assignments in his senior year , and he started at point guard all of his 32 appearances . Hawkins recorded career highs in all statistical categories with 30.6 minutes , 10.3 points , 2.9 rebounds , 5.2 assists , and 2.3 steals per game . He led the SEC in assists per game and total steals , while he was second in steals per game . During the 2004 NCAA tournament Hawkins debuted with 14 points and 4 assists against Florida A & M , and ended his career at Kentucky with 9 points , 2 rebounds , 2 assists and 2 steals in 26 minutes in the loss against UAB . At the end of the season he was named in the All-SEC Third Team by the Associated Press . Hawkins scored a total of 839 points for the Wildcats , and ranks 7th all-time in total assists with 468 , and 3rd in total steals with 199 .

Professional career
After the end of his senior season at Kentucky , Hawkins was automatically eligible for the 2004 NBA draft , but he was not selected by an NBA franchise . In July 2004 Hawkins signed with JuveCaserta in Italy : in 4 LegaDue games he averaged 8.5 points , 1.8 rebounds 2.3 assists , and 3 steals per game in 30.3 minutes of playing time . He then left the team and joined the Yakima Sun Kings of the Continental Basketball Association . He played 27 games ( 11 starts ) in the 2004–05 CBA season , averaging 12 points , 3.6 rebounds and 6.1 assists in 29.4 minutes per game .

Professor Timothy William Roy Briggs , ( born December 1957 ) is an orthopaedic surgeon at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital NHS Trust ( RNOH ) , chairman of the Federation of Specialist Hospitals , Chair of the Veterans Covenant Healthcare Alliance and a former president of the British Orthopaedic Association .
Early life
Tim Briggs was born in December 1957 . He qualified at the Royal London Hospital in 1982 .
Career
Briggs was appointed a consultant orthopaedic surgeon at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital in 1992 . He was a medical director at the RNOH for 15 years . He is chairman of the Federation of Specialist Hospitals and a former president of the British Orthopaedic Association .
He was appointed National Director for Clinical Quality and Efficiency by Jeremy Hunt in October 2015 . When appointed he said that surgical patients were at risk of infections because beds were not “ ring-fenced ” for those undergoing the same types of procedures . There was a 25-fold variation in infection rates for the same procedure in different hospitals . He had visited 211 hospitals and seen unwanted variation in practice . He thought that some consultants carrying out too few procedures to become sufficiently skilled , and in some places junior staff were given too much responsibility . His report on hip replacement concluded that at least 35 operations a year were needed before a surgeon could produce acceptable results . He produced tables showing the data both for hospitals and for individual surgeons and this had striking effects . The number of infections and failed operations fell , as did the cost of follow-up surgery and litigation . His `` Getting it Right First Time '' ( GIRFT ) expanded into 40 medical and surgical specialities . Jeremy Hunt attributes this to the `` unusual combination of competitiveness and altruism that is innate to most doctors '' .
Briggs served as the training programme director for the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital registrar ( resident ) training programme for over 20 years , supporting and leading the training of hundreds of trauma and orthopaedic surgeons during this time .

In statistics , a paired difference test is a type of location test that is used when comparing two sets of measurements to assess whether their population means differ . A paired difference test uses additional information about the sample that is not present in an ordinary unpaired testing situation , either to increase the statistical power , or to reduce the effects of confounders .
Specific methods for carrying out paired difference tests are , for normally distributed difference t-test ( where the population standard deviation of difference is not known ) and the paired Z-test ( where the population standard deviation of the difference is known ) , and for differences that may not be normally distributed the Wilcoxon signed-rank test .
The most familiar example of a paired difference test occurs when subjects are measured before and after a treatment . Such a `` repeated measures '' test compares these measurements within subjects , rather than across subjects , and will generally have greater power than an unpaired test . Another example comes from matching cases of a disease with comparable controls .
Use in reducing variance
Paired difference tests for reducing variance are a specific type of blocking . To illustrate the idea , suppose we are assessing the performance of a drug for treating high cholesterol . Under the design of our study , we enroll 100 subjects , and measure each subject 's cholesterol level . Then all the subjects are treated with the drug for six months , after which their cholesterol levels are measured again . Our interest is in whether the drug has any effect on mean cholesterol levels , which can be inferred through a comparison of the post-treatment to pre-treatment measurements .
The key issue that motivates the paired difference test is that unless the study has very strict entry criteria , it is likely that the subjects will differ substantially from each other before the treatment begins . Important baseline differences among the subjects may be due to their gender , age , smoking status , activity level , and diet .
There are two natural approaches to analyzing these data :
In an `` unpaired analysis '' , the data are treated as if the study design had actually been to enroll 200 subjects , followed by random assignment of 100 subjects to each of the treatment and control groups . The treatment group in the unpaired design would be viewed as analogous to the post-treatment measurements in the paired design , and the control group would be viewed as analogous to the pre-treatment measurements . We could then calculate the sample means within the treated and untreated groups of subjects , and compare these means to each other .
In a `` paired difference analysis '' , we would first subtract the pre-treatment value from the post-treatment value for each subject , then compare these differences to zero .
If we only consider the means , the paired and unpaired approaches give the same result . To see this , let be the observed data for the pair , and let . Also let , and denote , respectively , the sample means of the , the , and the . By rearranging terms we can see that
where n is the number of pairs . Thus the mean difference between the groups does not depend on whether we organize the data as pairs .
Although the mean difference is the same for the paired and unpaired statistics , their statistical significance levels can be very different , because it is easy to overstate the variance of the unpaired statistic . The variance of is
where and are the population standard deviations of the and data , respectively . Thus the variance of is lower if there is positive correlation within each pair . Such correlation is very common in the repeated measures setting , since many factors influencing the value being compared are unaffected by the treatment . For example , if cholesterol levels are associated with age , the effect of age will lead to positive correlations between the cholesterol levels measured within subjects , as long as the duration of the study is small relative to the variation in ages in the sample .
Power of the paired Z-test
Suppose we are using a Z-test to analyze the data , where the variances of the pre-treatment and post-treatment data and are known ( the situation with a t-test is similar ) . The unpaired Z-test statistic is
The power of the unpaired , one-sided test carried out at level can be calculated as follows :
where S is the standard deviation of D , Φ is the standard normal cumulative distribution function , and δ = EY2 − EY1 is the true effect of the treatment . The constant 1.64 is the 95th percentile of the standard normal distribution , which defines the rejection region of the test .
By a similar calculation , the power of the paired Z-test is
By comparing the expressions for power of the paired and unpaired tests , one can see that the paired test has more power as long as
This condition is met whenever , the within-pairs correlation , is positive .
A random effects model for paired testing
The following statistical model is useful for understanding the paired difference test
where is a random effect that is shared between the two values in the pair , and is a random noise term that is independent across all data points . The constant values are the expected values of the two measurements being compared , and our interest is in .
In this model , the capture `` stable confounders '' that have the same effect on the pre-treatment and post-treatment measurements . When we subtract to form cancel out , so do not contribute to the variance . The within-pairs covariance is
This is non-negative , so it leads to better performance for the paired difference test compared to the unpaired test , unless they are constant over , in which case the paired and unpaired tests are equivalent .
In less mathematical terms , the unpaired test assumes that the data in the two groups being compared are independent . This assumption determines the form for the variance of . However , when two measurements are made for each subject , it is unlikely that the two measurements are independent . If the two measurements within a subject are positively correlated , the unpaired test overstates the variance of , making it a conservative test in the sense that its actual type I error probability will be lower than the nominal level , with a corresponding loss of statistical power . In rare cases , the data may be negatively correlated within subjects , in which case the unpaired test becomes anti-conservative . The paired test is generally used when repeated measurements are made on the same subjects , since it has the correct level regardless of the correlation of the measurements within pairs .
Use in reducing confounding
Another application of paired difference testing arises when comparing two groups in a set of observational data , with the goal being to isolate the effect of one factor of interest from the effects of other factors that may play a role . For example , suppose teachers adopt one of two different approaches , denoted `` A '' and `` B '' , to teaching a particular mathematical topic . We may be interested in whether the performances of the students on a standardized mathematics test differ according to the teaching approach . If the teachers are free to adopt approach A or approach B , it is possible that teachers whose students are already performing well in mathematics will preferentially choose method A ( or vice versa ) . In this situation , a simple comparison between the mean performances of students taught with approach A and approach B will likely show a difference , but this difference is partially or entirely due to the pre-existing differences between the two groups of students . In this situation , the baseline abilities of the students serve as a confounding variable , in that they are related to both the outcome ( performance on the standardized test ) , and to the treatment assignment to approach A or approach B .
It is possible to reduce , but not necessarily eliminate , the effects of confounding variables by forming `` artificial pairs '' and performing a pairwise difference test . These artificial pairs are constructed based on additional variables that are thought to serve as confounders . By pairing students whose values on the confounding variables are similar , a greater fraction of the difference in the value of interest ( e.g . the standardized test score in the example discussed above ) , is due to the factor of interest , and a lesser fraction is due to the confounder . Forming artificial pairs for paired difference testing is an example of a general approach for reducing the effects of confounding when making comparisons using observational data called matching .
As a concrete example , suppose we observe student test scores X under teaching strategies and , and each student has either a `` high '' or `` low '' level of mathematical knowledge before the two teaching strategies are implemented . However , we do not know which students are in the `` high '' category and which are in the `` low '' category . The population mean test scores in the four possible groups are
and the proportions of students in the groups are
where .
The `` treatment difference '' among students in the `` high '' group is and the treatment difference among students in the `` low '' group is . In general , it is possible that the two teaching strategies could differ in either direction , or show no difference , and the effects could differ in magnitude or even in sign between the `` high '' and `` low '' groups . For example , if strategy B were superior to strategy A for well-prepared students , but strategy A were superior to strategy B for poorly prepared students , the two treatment differences would have opposite signs .
Since we do not know the baseline levels of the students , the expected value of the average test score among students in the A group is an average of those in the two baseline levels :
and similarly the average test score among students in the B group is
Thus the expected value of the observed treatment difference is
A reasonable null hypothesis is that there is no effect of the treatment within either the `` high '' or `` low '' student groups , so that . Under this null hypothesis , the expected value of will be zero if
and
This condition asserts that the assignment of students to the end teaching strategy groups is independent of their mathematical knowledge before the teaching strategies are implemented . If this holds , baseline mathematical knowledge is not a confounder , and conversely , if baseline mathematical knowledge is a confounder , the expected value of will generally differ from zero . If the expected value of under the null hypothesis is not equal to zero , then a situation where we reject the null hypothesis could either be due to an actual differential effect between teaching strategies and , or it could be due to non-independence in the assignment of students to the end groups ( even in the complete absence of an effect due to the teaching strategy ) .
This example illustrates that if we make a direct comparison between two groups when confounders are present , we do not know whether any difference that is observed is due to the grouping itself , or is due to some other factor . If we are able to pair students by an exact or estimated measure of their baseline mathematical ability , then we are only comparing students `` within rows '' of the table of means given above . Consequently , if the null hypothesis holds , the expected value of will equal zero , and statistical significance levels have their intended interpretation .

Piron 's Theorem ( 1964 ) is a famous representation theorem for quantum lattices .
He was appointed assistant professor in the physics department of the University of Geneva in 1969 and professor ordinarius in 1974 . He retired in 2000 .

Serrastretta is a town and comune in the province of Catanzaro in the Calabria region of southern Italy .
The town is bordered by Amato , Decollatura , Feroleto Antico , Lamezia Terme , Miglierina , Pianopoli , Platania and San Pietro Apostolo .
History
Serrastretta was founded by Jewish refugees fleeing the Inquisition , and was historically home to a notable Jewish community . Several families of Ukrainian Jewish refugees were invited into the town in 2022 , in hope to help restore the remaining Jewish presence in Serrastretta .
The Ner Tamid del Sud shul is the only operating synagogue in Calabria .
Economy
Serrastretta is a center of production of furniture , kitchens , door-frames , casings and furnishings of every kind . Above all are the woven-straw chairs , for which Serrastretta is considered to be one of the main Calabrese producers . The chair makers continue to construct chairs as in the past - a frame made of wood , to which the women expertly apply the woven straw seats with a special bush `` vuda '' , coming from the plants in the marshlands .
In the territory of Serrastretta also porcini mushrooms are found , particularly in areas where chestnut trees grow . There is also a museum devoted to the singer Dalida , whose parents originally came from Serrastretta .

Cyprus competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , from 5 to 21 August 2016 . This was the nation 's tenth consecutive appearance at the Summer Olympics .
Cyprus Olympic Committee sent a team of 16 athletes , 10 men and 6 women , to compete in seven different sports at the Games . The nation 's full roster in Rio de Janeiro was slightly larger by three athletes than those sent to London 2012 . Among the sporting events represented by the nation 's athletes , Cyprus made its Olympic debut in artistic gymnastics and women 's road cycling .
The Cypriot delegation featured six returning Olympians , with only four of them having participated in more than two editions of the Olympic Games , including high jumper Kyriakos Ioannou , sprinter Eleni Artymata , 33-year-old windsurfer Andreas Cariolou ( the oldest and most experienced competitor of the team ) , and Laser sailor Pavlos Kontides , who won a silver medal in London four years earlier . The nation 's first ever Olympic medalist , and one of the potential frontrunners for gold in the Laser class at his third Games , Kontides was selected to lead the Cypriot team as the flag bearer in the opening ceremony .
Unlike the previous Olympics , Cyprus failed to earn a single medal in Rio de Janeiro . Kontides , Ioannou , and Serbian-born hurdler Milan Trajkovic came close to adding another medal for Cyprus at these Games , but finished seventh in the finals of their respective sporting events .
Athletics
Cypriot athletes have so far achieved qualifying standards in the following athletics events ( up to a maximum of 3 athletes in each event ) :
Track & road events
Field events
Cycling
Road
Cyprus has qualified one rider in the women 's Olympic road race by virtue of her top 100 individual placement in the 2016 UCI World Rankings .
Gymnastics
Artistic
Cyprus has entered one artistic gymnast for the first time into the Olympic competition . Marios Georgiou had claimed his Olympic spot in the men 's apparatus and all-around events at the Olympic Test Event in Rio de Janeiro .
Men
Sailing
Cypriot sailors have qualified one boat in each of the following classes through the 2014 ISAF Sailing World Championships , the individual fleet Worlds , and European qualifying regattas .
M = Medal race ; EL = Eliminated – did not advance into the medal race
Shooting
Cyprus has qualified one shooter each in the men 's and women 's skeet by virtue of their best finishes at the 2015 ISSF World Cup series , and the World Shotgun Championships , as long as they obtained a minimum qualifying score ( MQS ) by 31 March 2016 .
Qualification Legend : Q = Qualify for the next round ; q = Qualify for the bronze medal ( shotgun )
Swimming
Cyprus has received a Universality invitation from FINA to send two swimmers ( one male and one female ) to the Olympics .
Weightlifting
Cyprus has qualified one male weightlifter for the Olympics by virtue of his top 15 individual finish , among those who had not secured any quota places through the World or European Championships , in the IWF World Rankings as of 20 June 2016 . The place was awarded to Greek-born Antonis Martasidis in the men 's middleweight division ( 85 kg ) .
On 25 July 2016 , Martasidis was ejected from the Games , after testing positive for the banned substance .

Cæcilie Norby ( born 9 September 1964 ) is a Danish jazz and rock singer .
She was born in Frederiksberg , Denmark , into a musical family . Her father , Erik Norby , is classical composer and her mother , Solveig Lumholt , is an opera singer . She was a founding member of the band Street Beat in 1982 . For two years , she was a member of the jazz-rock band Frontline . From 1985 to 1993 , she worked with singer Nina Forsberg in the rock band One-Two . During the 1990s , she turned to jazz and released her first solo album for Blue Note .
The self-titled debut recording was co-produced by Niels Lan Doky as was her following album My Corner of the Sky from 1996 , which prominently featured American musicians like pianists David Kikoski , Joey Calderazzo and Terri Lyne Carrington on drums . Scott Robinson and Randy Brecker already appeared on her debut as guests each on one track . Michael Brecker contributes to yet another track . The repertoire for both recordings included only a few jazz standards like `` Summertime '' or `` Just One of Those Things '' , instead she and Lan Doky arranged classic popular songs for a jazz line-up , like `` Wild Is the Wind '' , `` By the Time I Get to Phoenix '' and a track by Curtis Mayfield on the first album , `` The Look of Love '' , `` Life on Mars '' , `` Spinning Wheel '' and `` Set Them Free '' by Sting on the second . For both albums Norby also wrote lyrics to compositions by Randy Brecker , Chick Corea , Don Grolnick and Wayne Shorter . Both albums gained wide attention and five-digit sales , especially in Denmark and also in Japan .
Her third album Queen of Bad Excuses , released in 1999 , was a collaboration between her and Lars Danielsson , who already played bass throughout My Corner of the Sky . This time all compositions are originals by Norby , while she and Danielsson arranged , programmed and produced all tracks together . Danielsson played also guitar , cello , electric piano , keyboards and even drums on one track . With Ben Besiakov and long-time companion Lars Jansson on piano , Anders Kjellberg and Per Lindvall from Sweden alternating on drums with Billy Hart , who was also part of her debut recording , the line-up is accentuated by the guitar of John Scofield on more than half of the album , and saxophonist Hans Ulrik and Xavier Desandre Navarre on percussion .

Wei ( ) , known in historiography as the Western Wei ( ) , was an imperial dynasty of China that followed the disintegration of the Northern Wei . One of the Northern dynasties during the era of the Northern and Southern dynasties , it ruled the western part of northern China from 535 to 557 . As with the Northern Wei dynasty that preceded it , the ruling family of the Western Wei were members of the Tuoba clan of the Xianbei .
History
After the Xianbei general Yuwen Tai killed the Northern Wei emperor Yuan Xiu , he installed Yuan Baoju as emperor of Western Wei while Yuwen Tai would remain as the virtual ruler . Although smaller than the Eastern Wei in territory and population , Western Wei was able to withstand the attacks from the eastern empire , most notably at the Battle of Shayuan in 537 . Due to its better economical conditions , Western Wei was even able to conquer the whole western part of the Liang empire in the south and occupied the territory of modern Sichuan . In 557 Yuwen Tai 's nephew Yuwen Hu deposed Emperor Gong and placed Yuwen Tai 's son Yuwen Jue on the throne , ending Western Wei and establishing Northern Zhou .

The Grand Howl is a ceremony used by Cub Scouts and Brownies . It was devised by Robert Baden-Powell , the author of the scouting guide Scouting for Boys , and is based on the Mowgli stories in Rudyard Kipling 's Jungle Book . In the ceremony , Cubs act out the wolves greeting Akela , the `` Old Wolf '' , at the Council Rock and are reminded of the Cub Scout Promise . Baden-Powell also created a Grand Howl for Brownie Guides , which was in imitation of an owl instead of a wolf . It has been used as an opening and closing ceremony as well as a method of conveying thanks or appreciation by all sections of Scouting .
Origin
In the wild , wolves howl to assemble the pack usually before and after hunts , to pass on an alarm particularly at a den site , to locate each other during a storm or while crossing unfamiliar territory , and to communicate across great distances . Grand howls had been part of social occasions since at least the 1850s .
Five years after the founding of the Scout movement , Baden-Powell and others worked on a scheme for those who were too young to join the Boy Scouts at the age of 11 , initially called `` Junior Scouts '' . By the time of the launch of the scheme , Baden-Powell had obtained the approval of his friend and neighbor , Rudyard Kipling , to use the Jungle Book as a theme . Under the name of `` Wolf Cubs '' , the 8- to 10-year-old boys would take part in basic versions of the activities enjoyed by the older Boy Scouts , but within a background of the jungle in the Mowgli stories of Kipling 's 1898 book . The Cubs would act out scenes from the stories , and the adult leaders would adopt the names of characters from the book . For example , the leader in charge would be titled Akela , after the character Akela who led the titular Mowgli 's wolf pack in Kipling 's novel .
Baden-Powell book , entitled The Wolf Cub 's Handbook , was published on 2 December 1916 . In the first chapter , he describes the following scene in The Jungle Book and provides some additional context for the Grand Howl ceremony :
Original Grand Howl
The original instructions for the Grand Howl , described by Vera Barclay and Baden-Powell in The Wolf Cub 's Handbook .
Scouter : `` Pack - Pack - Pack ! '' This calls the Cubs into a Parade Circle .
The Cubs reply as they run to their places in the circle .
Cubs : `` Pack ! ''
As the Scouter enters the circle , the Cubs squat down on their heels with their `` fore paws '' on the ground between their feet and their knees out on either side .
Cubs : `` Ah-kay-la ! We-e-e-e-ll do-o-o-o o-o-o-u-u-r BEST ! '' On the word `` BEST '' , the Cubs jump to their feet with two fingers of each hand at the sides of their heads , to resemble a wolf 's ears .
A Sixer : `` Dyb - dyb - dyb -dyb '' The word `` dyb '' means `` Do Your Best ''
circle around leader DYB DYB DOB which is the first part of the Cub Promise and was the original Wolf Cub motto .
On the fourth `` dyb '' , the Cubs lower their left hands and the fingers of their right hands extend to form the Wolf Cub salute .
Cubs : `` We-e-e-e-ll dob-dob-dob-dob '' , meaning `` We 'll do our best '' .
National variants
United Kingdom
In 1966 , a complete review of the UK Scout Association , The Chief Scouts ' Advance Party Report , recommended that less emphasis be placed on the Jungle Book for Wolf Cubs , who were to be renamed Cub Scouts . Although the Grand Howl was to be retained , it was revised , replacing the `` dybs '' with plain language to `` make the significance clearer to parents and public '' . The recommendations were accepted and began to be implemented in October 1966 . The revised Grand Howl is as follows :
Pack in circle .
Cub Scout Leader in centre , arms outstretched facing Sixer ;
Cub Scout Leader arms down ;
Pack squats .
Pack : `` Akela ! We 'll do our best '' .
Sixer : `` Cubs ! Do your best '' .
Cubs : `` We will do our best '' , giving the Scout salute ( which had replaced the two-finger salute in the Cub Section ) .
Following a further programme review between 2000 and 2002 , the Grand Howl became optional , allowing Packs to adopt themes other than the Jungle Book - although local groups had always adapted the ceremony .
The independent Baden-Powell Scouts ' Association and British Boy Scouts and British Girl Scouts Association continue with the original Grand Howl .
United States
The Cub Scout programme of the Boy Scouts of America and Brownies of the Girl Scouts of the USA have used the traditional Grand Howl as a `` special recognition ceremony '' with the person being honoured ( a guest , parent or member of the Pack ) , standing in the centre of the circle . In addition , a Short Grand Howl can be used as follows :
Canada
The Cub Scouts of Scouts Canada use the traditional Grand Howl . The following version is used in French speaking Packs :
Australia
The Grand Howl used by the Cub Scouts of Scouts Australia is as follows :
New Zealand
The Grand Howl used by the Cubs of Scouts New Zealand is identical to the version currently used in the United Kingdom .
Brownies
A junior section of Girl Guides started in 1914 in the United Kingdom , under the name of `` Rosebuds '' ; this name was disliked by girls and it was soon amended to Brownies , being themed on the story by Juliana Ewing . In Baden-Powell 's 1918 book , `` Girl Guiding : A Handbook for Brownies , Guides and Rangers '' , the Grand Howl is described as `` the grandest salute a Pack ( of Brownies ) can give , and is only for very special occasions '' . Baden-Powell describes how the Brownies should begin in a squatting position , in the same way as the Cub equivalent , but repeating `` Tu-whit , tu-whit , Tu-whoo-oo '' three times , each time getting louder and rising higher , until at the end of the third repetition , the Brownies were to jump in the air and clap their hands above their heads .
In the United Kingdom , the 1966 report called Tomorrow 's Guide by a Working Party set up to revise and update the programme of the Girl Guides Association , recommended a reduction in the number of ceremonies used by Brownies ; the Grand Howl was not retained . The Brownie Grand Howl is still used by the Girl Guides of Canada .
Cultural impact
A Wolf Cub Grand Howl takes place in George Orwell 's A Clergyman 's Daughter .

There he taught various composition , liturgy , directing , and score reading classes as well as co-founding the Leeds University Liturgical Choir .
Music composing
Composing for many different instruments and ensembles ( piano , organ , voice , chamber ensemble , wind orchestra ) , Wilby is most known for his compositions for brass band . Many of Wilby 's pieces are based on his strong Christian beliefs . Famous works that fall in this category are ... Dove Descending , Revelation , and The New Jerusalem . Many of Wilby 's works are written especially to be used as test pieces in brass band contests all over the world . One recent composition to fit this description is Vienna Nights , which was commissioned as the test piece for the 2006 British Open Brass Band Championship held in Symphony Hall , Birmingham . Most famously though Paganini Variations , one of his finest pieces of work , which was selected as the test piece for the 2011 Regional Championships ( Championship Section ) and has been used as the test piece for many other major competitions over the years , and has been recorded by a number of bands including Black Dyke , Fodens and Grimethorpe .
... Dove Descending was featured by Black Dyke Band at the 2007 BBC Promenade Concerts in a day devoted to music for brass . Wilby also wrote the descriptive Northern Lights commissioned by the Black Dyke Band which was scored for a brass band and 4 dancers . It was later adapted for the Contest Stage when it was selected for the Butlins Mineworkers Championships in January 2007 .
One of his later compositions is entitled `` A Brontë Mass '' which was commissioned for the Leeds Philharmonic Society , in memory of their late Chairman , John Brodwell . The work includes poems by the Brontë sisters and text from Latin Mass . This piece premiered on Saturday 24 November 2007 at Leeds Town Hall . A recording , by The Bach Choir and Black Dyke Band , was made at Blackheath Halls in November 2009 and was released on a CD called Red Priest in September 2010 . The title track of this CD `` Red Priest '' was commissioned by Black Dyke Band and first performed in the Brucknerhaus , Linz , Austria in May 2010 as part of the European Brass Band Championships . It was subsequently chosen as the test piece for the 2011 British Open Brass Band Championship .
Commission
In 2013 he delivered a commission by the Halifax Choral Society to compose an oratorio in the English tradition for the Society 's bicentenary in 2017 . The work , The Holy Face is based on the life of John the Baptist , patron saint of Halifax . It was recorded in the Summer of 2017 and is to be presented for the first time in Halifax in October 2017 .

Harry Lawrence Bradfer-Lawrence ( 1 April 1887 – 19 October 1965 ) was an antiquarian with a particular interest in Norfolk and Yorkshire , England .
Biography
He started a successful career as a Land-agent in Norfolk , interrupted only by the First World War , when he was commissioned in the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve . In 1935 , he moved to Yorkshire as land-agent to Sir William Aykroyd , Baronet of Grantley Hall . Also employed by Hammonds ' brewery in Bradford , in 1942 rising to become Chairman , as well as Managing Director . He was to remain Chairman of United Breweries Limited , as Hammonds became through merger , until 1962 . Residing in Ripon , at Grantley Grange and then Sharow End , he died on 19 October 1965 .
Historical interests
He was elected to the Norfolk and Norwich Archaeological Society in 1914 , and during his years in that county contributed a number of articles to its journal Norfolk Archaeology as well as serving as a member of the Council of that Society . His association continued as vice-president until his death . Photographs taken in Norfolk by Bradfer-Lawrence are held in the Conway Library at The Courtauld Institute of Art , London , whose archive , of primarily architectural images , is being digitised under the wider Courtauld Connects project .
Elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1924 , as Treasurer for twenty years from 1944 , Bradfer-Lawrence greatly improved the Society 's financial position .
Bradfer-Lawrence quickly became interested in the history of Yorkshire , being accepted to membership of the Yorkshire Archaeological Society on 31 January 1936 , and served on its council for many years .
He was to maintain a lively interest in all matters antiquarian and was to build a remarkable collection of charters , seals , manuscripts and books ; it comes as no surprise to note he was a member of the exclusive Roxburghe Club .
Bradfer-Lawrence must have taken a great interest in the sale by auction of two 15th century works printed by William Caxton , by the Ripon Cathedral Library in 1960 , for he was able to have—presumably unique—photographic facsimiles made up for his own library .
Both the Norfolk Record Society and the Yorkshire Archaeological Society were to become beneficiaries of his remarkable collection . The latter , whose extensive library and archives are in Leeds , benefited from a valuable collection , containing superb examples of family and estate documents , medieval charters , accounts , maps , manorial records and letters , relating to the county , originating from the 12th to the 20th century . The British Museum also holds a number of artefacts , mainly from excavations in Bawsey Norfolk , and some prints that were acquired from or donated by Bradfer-Lawrence during his lifetime .

Fanny Juliet Passavant , FLA ( 16 October 1849 – 27 September 1944 ) , was the first Librarian of the University of Leeds , in West Yorkshire , England , and of its predecessor the Yorkshire College . She was the only woman to hold a position of University Librarian when the college gained university status in 1904 .
Biography
Born in 1849 , Passavant was a member of a family of Huguenot refugees who settled in Basel and Geneva in the 16th century . Her grandfather was ( 1751–1827 ) , a pastor of the Reformed Church and childhood friend of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe . Passavant was appointed in 1885 as the librarian of the Yorkshire College of Science . The college became the University of Leeds when it received a royal charter in 1904 . Initially her role was expected to be clerical but Passavant worked on the cataloging and increasing the number of volumes . From an initial catalogue of about 4,000 books to the 85,000 the library contained when she retired Passavant 's role became increasingly professional . Passavant joined the Library Association in 1903 becoming a Fellow later based on her experience and position .
Passavant retired in 1919 . On 30 November 2021 Leeds Civic Trust erected a blue plaque to honour her memory , on the wall of the university 's Great Hall building where the first university library had been located . The university 's vice-chancellor , Professor Simone Buitendijk , said at the unveiling :
A lover of choral music , Passavant was a long time member of the Leeds Philharmonic Society choir and a committee member of the society as well as being a member of the Leeds Musical Festival choir .

Sheet Music is the self-produced eleventh album by American R & B singer Barry White , and the second release on his own CBS-affiliated custom label , Unlimited Gold . Although it peaked at # 19 in the R & B charts , it was a commercial disappointment . `` Love Makin ' Music '' was the most successful of the single releases , peaking at # 25 in the R & B charts . White also recorded this track as well as `` She 's Everything to Me '' in Spanish for the Latin-American market as `` Mi nueva canción '' and `` Ella es todo para mí '' respectively . The London branch of CBS Records went for `` Rum and Coke '' as the second single , but as none of his singles on his new labels had managed to reach the UK Singles Charts , they stopped releasing any further singles off any of his following 4 albums . The Netherlands belatedly released the track `` Ghetto Letto '' as a single in August 1981 , choosing it over White 's then current single `` Louie Louie '' .

Unsuccessful Barry & Glodean follow-up album
For White 's next LP he went into the studio with his wife Glodean White ( née James ) , former lead singer of his girl group Love Unlimited who had by now disbanded , to record an album of duets . Released in March 1981 with a lavish cover shot of the couple , taken by photographer Todd Gray , the album and it 's three singles `` I Want You '' , `` You 're the Only One for Me '' , and `` Did n't We Make It Happen , Baby '' were White 's first to miss the Billboard charts altogether , a fact that White blamed on CBS not pressing enough copies to meet demand . The couple finally appeared on Soul Train , performing the tracks `` I Want You '' and `` The Better Love Is ( The Worse It Is When It 's Over ) '' , September 19 , 1981 , six months after the album had been released , but by then the momentum was lost . White debuted his next single , a cover of Richard Berry 's `` Louie Louie '' on the same show , off his next album Beware .

The Château de Wangenbourg is a ruined castle in the commune of Wangenbourg-Engenthal in the Bas-Rhin département of France .
In 1504 , Holy Roman Emperor Maximilien I , having vanquished the Prince-elector , Philipp , in the war of succession of Bavaria , confiscated the castle from the Lords of Wangen , cousins Hans and Stephan von Wangen , for the favor to count Tiestein , who himself gave it to the Archbishop of Strasbourg , Wilhelm III von Hohnstein , in 1516 . Nevertheless , a branch of descendants of the von Wangens , Georg and Hartmann , continued to occupy the castle . Between 1535 and 1550 , they reconstructed their logis in the Renaissance style ( see photograph below ) .
From 1578 , the Archbishop of Strasbourg and the lords of Wangen disputed property rights concerning the castle . The Wangens were expelled in 1578 , but re-established their rights in 1595 . In 1680 , the castle was occupied by French troops . In 1702 , it was in ruins .
Restoration of the castle started at the beginning of the 20th century , and again in 1931 . The footbridge in the photograph was constructed in 1961 to replace the old drawbridge .
Plan
Remains
The vast polygonal enceinte is still visible , as well as the bases of the walls on the interior buildings . The castle ruins have been listed since 6 December 1898 as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture and is privately owned .

Catostylidae is a family of jellyfish . Members of this family are characterized by their thick , sausage-like oral arms .
Description
Members of the family Catostylidae are small marine jellyfish with domed bells . The eight short oral arms are broad and three-sided . There is a network of branching canals linked with the primary ring canal , but these are not joined to the gastrovascular cavity except through the sixteen or thirty two radial canals . Some of these radial canals do not extend to the edge of the bell . There are eight sense organs , known as rhopalia , which have canals extending to the margin of the bell .
These jellyfish swim in jerks by contracting their circular and radial muscles , which decreases the volume of water enclosed under the bell , before relaxing them again and repeating the sequence . They have no control over the direction of locomotion and drift with the currents and tides .

Princess Tatiana von Metternich-Winneburg ( born Princess Tatiana Hilarionovna Vassiltchikova ( ) ; 1 January 1915 – 26 July 2006 ) was a Russian aristocrat , philanthropist , artist , and patron of the arts . She published her books and watercolours under the name Tatiana von Metternich . She supported charity , especially the Red Cross and the Order of St. Lazarus , which she served as Grand Bailiff for Germany . She was a founding member of the Rheingau Musik Festival , made parts of Schloss Johannisberg available as concert venues for the festival and served as the president of its Kuratorium until her death .
Family
Tatiana von Metternich-Winneburg was born in Saint Petersburg , the second daughter of Prince Hilarion Sergueïevitch Vassiltchikov ( 1881–1969 ) , a member of the Russian Imperial Parliament Fourth Duma , and his wife , the former Princess Lidiya Leonidovna Vyazemskaya ( 1886–1946 ) . On 6 September 1941 in Berlin-Grunewald , she married Paul Alfons von Metternich-Winneburg , Prince of Metternich-Winneburg , Grandee of Spain , 1941 of Portella and Count of Königswart ( 1917–1992 ) , son of Clemens von Metternich , Prince of Metternich-Winneburg , and Isabel de Silva y Carvajal , countess of Castillejo .
Biography
The family fled Russia in 1919 , following the Bolshevik October Revolution by joining a group of people who had been evacuated by the British fleet . King George V of the United Kingdom was the cousin of the last Tsar and maternal nephew of Empress Marie Feodorovna . King George V persuaded Prime Minister David Lloyd George to send a ship to the Crimea to save his aunt but the Empress refused to leave unless those who wished to leave with her were taken as well . The British sent additional ships to take the entire group including the Vassiltchikov family .
They took refuge , initially in France , where she and her sister Princess Marie Vassiltchikov ( 1917–1978 ) , called Missie , were educated at the Lycée of St Germain-en-Laye . She studied painting in Munich and later the family rejoined her father in Lithuania where she worked as a secretary at the British Embassy . She moved to England but was unable to get a work permit so she moved to Germany where she eventually employed as a translator by the Foreign Office . Her sister Missie joined her shortly before they settled in Berlin . Due to the tendency of Nazi party members to bypass the Foreign Ministry staff when formulating policy as described in the Berlin diaries , the foreign office effectively became a gathering place for civilian members of the anti-Nazi resistance . Her sister kept diaries of her life in the plotters ' circle . Her sister described these years in her memoirs The Berlin Diaries 1940–1945 of Marie `` Missie '' Vassiltchikov ( 1985 ) .
Tatiana met her future husband , who was then an ordinary soldier in the German army . He was a half-Austrian and half-Spanish member of the Metternich family . His great-grandfather was Austrian Chancellor Prince Klemens von Metternich , who established a lasting peace at the Congress of Vienna in 1815 . In recognition of the Chancellor 's services , the Emperor of Austria gave him a title and the estate of Johannisberg on the Rhine . In the Spanish Civil War , he volunteered on the Nationalist side to fight with his cousins and friends . They were married on 6 September 1941 by Father Shahovski , later Archbishop of John of San Francisco . As a son of a Spanish noble woman with close links to Spain , the Spanish Embassy provided support for the wedding .
The couple lived in Berlin and then in the Metternich family 's Schloss Königswart in the Egerland ( now in the Czech Republic ) . During the war , she administered the Metternich estates while her husband served in the German army . When her husband told her of his transfer to the Russian front , she went to Army HQ without his knowledge to ask for a transfer . A few days later , she received a call informing her that her husband would be transferred as Liaison officer to the Spanish Blue Division .
After the expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia in 1945 , they lived in Schloss Johannisberg , the family 's estate in Geisenheim , in the Rheingau . It had been destroyed by bombing in 1942 . They rebuilt the estate and ran the winery . The East Wing was restored , but not as living quarters , rather it was turned into a hall for indoor tennis . In collaboration with Henkell & Söhnlein , a winery and member of the Oetker Group , they created the sparkling wine , `` Fürst von Metternich '' . In 1974 , they shared ownership of the castle and the winery with the Oetker Group . After her husband 's death in 1992 , she sold the property completely to Oetker , but retained the right to live on the premises .
Tatiana von Metternich published several books , some of them illustrated with her own watercolours . In 1976 , she published her memoirs under the title Tatiana : Five Passports in a Shifting Europe , which she updated and republished in 1988 as Tatiana : Full Circle in a Shifting Europe .
In 1987 , she was a founding member of the Rheingau Musik Festival , together with Michael Herrmann , Claus Wisser , Carl Jung , Walter Fink and others . She made parts of Schloss Johannisberg available as concert venues for the festival , turning the East Wing of the building into a concert hall . After her husband 's death , the hall was named `` Fürst-von-Metternich-Saal '' . Concerts of sacred music are performed in the Basilika ; chamber music , including the annual composer 's portrait , in the Fürst-von-Metternich-Saal ; open-air concerts are performed in various courts ; and the annual `` Sommerfest '' takes place on all public grounds of the estate . She served as the first president of the festival 's curators until her death and was kept on the list as `` Gründungsvorsitzende '' ( founding president ) .
Upon her husband 's death in 1992 she faced the shock and shame of learning he had left a considerable portion of his fortune to a mistress , which meant she was forced her to sell her remaining share of Schloss Johannisberg to the Oetker family . She was permitted to remain at the Schloss until her death ; suffering ill health in her last years . She adopted a relative , Don Alvaro de Salinas , as her heir .
She sponsored charity projects , especially in the Order of Saint Lazarus , which she joined in 1978 . She succeeded her husband as the organization 's `` Grand Bailiff '' in Germany until her death at Schloss Johannisberg on 26 July 2006 . She and her husband are buried next to the Basilika of Schloss Johannisberg .

Salem Moravian Church was founded in Oldham , Lancashire , England in 1825 by John Lees . Br Lees , who lived in the Clarksfield area of Oldham , was associated with the Moravian Settlement at Fairfield in Droylsden .
History
The work of the Moravian Church in the Oldham area dates to 1772 , when its ministers preached at Greenacres . The services drew congregations from Lees and Oldham and led to the creation of a preaching station in Clarksfield , which was supported and serviced by the Moravian Settlement at Dukinfield in Cheshire .
In the 1820s , John Lees , a prosperous member of the Fairfield Moravian Settlement , who came from Clarksfield , hired a large room in Clarksfield to hold Moravian services . The minutes of the Fairfield Elders ' Conference in November 1822 report that Br Lees filled the room and offered it to the church to preach the Gospel . Arrangements were made to supply it with preachers from Fairfield and Dukinfield every Sunday . Sr Elizabeth Smith agreed to teach at a girls ' day school to be established in association with the new congregation .
Br Lees and two of his brothers built a chapel with two schoolrooms in Clarksfield at their own expense . They laid the foundation stones on 28 June 1824 and on 7 August 1825 the chapel was consecrated and opened by James Liley . Br John Smith was the first resident minister in 1827 .
In 1865 , Salem played a significant part in creating a new Moravian congregation in Westwood in Oldham .
A late 20th-century church building has replaced the 1825 edifice .
Salem Moravian Church continued at Lees Road , Clarksfield until 21st August 2022 on which date the last service was held and the building closed . The congregation was merged with the Moravian Church at Royton .

Uniterm is a subject indexing system introduced by Mortimer Taube in 1951 . The name is a contraction of `` unit '' and `` term '' , referring to its use of single words as the basis of the index , the `` uniterms '' . Taube referred to the overall concept as `` Coordinate Indexing '' , but today the entire concept is generally referred to as Uniterm as well .
Uniterm is designed to allow rapid lookups on topic keywords and then cross-reference those keywords across multiple topics in order to find documents that match all of the terms . The result of a uniterm search is a set of accession numbers that can then be used to retrieve the matching documents . Uniterm is based on existing accession numbers , so it is technically a post-coordinate system . This is opposed to a pre-coordinate system , where the subject of the document results it being given a particular number , as in the Dewey Decimal Classification . Uniterm was among the most popular post-coordinate indexing systems , although some of its success was due to Taube 's company winning contracts to index huge technical libraries .
History
The development of Uniterm , and other new indexing systems , ultimately traces its history to the late World War II period . Aware of the advanced aircraft and rocket technologies developed in Germany , the US formed Operation Lusty and UK the similar Fedden Mission in order to gather as much of these materials as possible . Along with examples of the aircraft and various weapons , these efforts returned millions of pages of technical documentation . The desire to ease access into these enormous collections led to a great expansion in the field of information retrieval .
In the US , the aeronautical collection was first sent to US Army Air Force at Wright Field , but over time it was merged with similar caches of US research to form an ever-growing collection of technical papers . The collection grew so large and varied that a new operational group , the Armed Services Technical Information Agency ( ASTIA ) , was formed in 1951 to manage it . This group eventually came under the management of the Atomic Energy Commission . ASTIA began running experiments in indexing the collection , and it was from this work that Uniterm emerged .
Taube introduced the Uniterm concept in a 1951 paper , `` Coordinate Indexing of Scientific Fields '' , part of the Symposium on Mechanical Aids to Chemical Documentation . The next year , in partnership with Gerald Sophar , Taube formed Documentation , Inc . The company offered commercial retrieval and indexing services . Among their largest efforts was a 1958 contract with the newly formed NASA to index their entire technical library , and later , make microfilm copies of it .
Taube 's original paper indicates that a significant advantage of the Uniterm concept is its ability to be automated . In essence , the uniterm lookup process is looking for the intersection of several terms , or as Taube referred to it , the `` coordinates '' . To this end , they partnered with IBM to develop the `` Continuous Multiple Access Collator '' , or COMAC . Users would make search term selections on a punch card writer and then feed them into the COMAC , also known as the IBM 9900 . The COMAC pulled those uniterm cards and then used optical systems to find matching items . It then returned a new card with those numbers that was then sent into the IBM 305 RAMAC , the first computer with a hard drive , which returned the complete document information for those numbers .
Concept
Uniterm is based on the concept of making a separate card catalog that refers to the documents in the collection by their accession numbers . The accession numbers have no meaning in the Uniterm index , so they may use any of the common systems like the Dewey Decimal Classification or Universal Decimal Classification , or in many cases , simply an incrementing serial number .
As new works are added to the collection , the librarian will make a normal index card for the primary card index as they would for any work . Additionally , they will select a small number of keywords from the title or body of the work that can be used to look it up , and these are also written on the card . For instance , a document on icing of air ducts in aircraft might be filed under `` air '' , `` ducts '' and `` icing '' , but perhaps not `` aircraft '' which would be found on too many documents .
The librarian then looks in the Uniterm catalog for cards with those terms on them . If they are not found , they are created by writing the keyword at the top of the card and then dividing the lower portion into ten vertical sections , labeled 0 to 9 . The last digit of the accession number is then written on the card in that column , for instance , if the last digit of the accession number is 5 , the entire accession number would be written in column 5 . If the card for that term is found in the collection , the new accession is simply added to the correct column of the existing card .
To retrieve a document , the user selects potentially useful key terms and extracts those cards from the uniterm index . To find this article , the user might select `` indexing '' and `` library '' , and retrieves those cards from the uniterm catalog . These cards will have numbers for many different documents , for instance , the `` library '' card might contain a listing for a book on the Library of Alexandria . However , only those documents on `` library indexing '' will appear on both cards .
The user then scans the card to see if a particular accession number appears on both cards ; splitting the cards into 10 columns is intended to make the visual scanning process simpler . Numbers that appear on both cards are likely relevant to the search , and can then be looked up directly or by looking in the main card catalog if partial accession numbers are used .
The cards in the main catalog also contain the uniterms used to file that entry , forming a cross-index . A user that selects the cards for `` propeller '' and `` aeroplane '' may find many intersecting works on the cards . Returning to the main index they can look at the uniterms recorded on the main index cards and find that there are other terms that commonly appear , perhaps `` aerodynamics '' . These might suggest additional terms that could be used to narrow their search . They can then return to the uniterm catalog to apply these new terms to return additional documents or further focus their search .
Advantages and criticisms
Uniterm was popular in the United States for large technical collections , which led to considerable study on the system . One particularly useful effort was the National Security Agency 's effort to catalog their 70,000-work collection .
They found one major advantage of the Uniterm system was that the librarians did not have to have an understanding of the material in order to correctly catalog it . Simply selecting terms that appeared in the title or were obviously important within the text would often result in a useful uniterm entry . This contrasted with traditional hierarchical approaches , where selecting the proper spot within the hierarchy often required some , or considerable , knowledge of the underlying field .
The same effort also revealed a number of problems and suggested solutions . One was that synonyms presented a problem ; was a paper on `` air ducts '' the same or different than one on `` air intakes '' ? They suggested this could be addressed by splitting the works into sets of about 1,000 entries and building the catalog out in sections . The first set of 1,000 documents might produce 1,000 uniterms , which were then studied to weed out synonyms . When synonyms were found , they added `` see also '' headings to those cards . The second set would then be added , using those synonyms . They found that the addition of new terms started to flatten out at about 4,000 entries , and after 10,000 only very specific technical terms were being added .
A concern that was raised when the concept was first introduced was that the terms might return a large number of false positives due to terms being used to describe completely different concepts . In particular , terms that might mean different things depending on their order were believed to be an issue . If one was looking for `` American exports to Canada '' , `` Canada '' , `` US '' and `` exports '' would return a large number of documents on Canadian exports into the US as well , perhaps overwhelming the result set .
However , this was found not to be a serious problem in practice , and those few examples that did crop up were solved by adding `` delta cards '' , see-also entries that incorporated a direction . In this case , the `` US '' card would have a see-also entry for `` USΔ '' , that card would only contain those entries from the US . Uniterms on the USΔ page are only those for US exports .

Library cataloging and classification
Hernandez v. New York , 500 U.S. 352 ( 1991 ) , was a decision by the United States Supreme Court , which held that a prosecutor may dismiss jurors who are bilingual in Spanish and English from juries that will consider Spanish-language testimony .
Peremptory challenges are used to remove jurors thought to be undesirable for virtually any reason by either side in a court case . However , in Batson v. Kentucky ( 1986 ) , the Supreme Court ruled that peremptory challenges may not be used to remove jurors because of their race . In Hernandez , the Supreme Court had to decide whether the peremptory exclusion of two Hispanic jurors was tantamount to exclusion because of race—and therefore violated the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution.The case is recognized as expanding a Batson challenge to a peremptory strike based on a juror 's ethnicity .
Procedural history of the case
Dinosio Hernandez was convicted by a jury of attempted murder on January 30 , 1987 , in New York Supreme Court . He appealed his conviction , claiming that under the U.S. Supreme Court 's recent decision under Batson v. Kentucky , the prosecutor unconstitutionally used peremptory strikes against jury panel members who had Hispanic last names . On appeal , the court found that because the prosecutor had only challenged the three potential jurors with Hispanic surnames . However , the appellate court found the prosecutor has a nondiscriminatory reason for the challenge because the stricken jurors either had a relative prosecuted by the district attorney 's office or spoke Spanish and may not accept the translated testimony as final .
Hernandez proceeded with his Batson claim and appealed to the New York Court of Appeals . New York 's highest court of appeals agreed with the appellate court that Hernandez made a prima facie case of discrimination . The court did not find that striking a juror based on their language alone was reversible error as it was a `` legitimate neutral ground '' for the prosecutor to be concerned of the Spanish-speaking jurors fidelity to a translation court record . The majority noted that the trial judge was present during the entirety of the questioning and was satisfied with the prosecutor 's actions as the stricken jurors ' body-language signaled doubt .
Judge Kaye authored the dissent , criticizing the majority for the diminished protections of Batson for New York and for deciding the case on federal and not state law . Rather than allow Batson 's contours be defined over decades of litigation , Kaye argued that deciding the matter on state law would allow clearer protections earlier for New York residents . On the merits , Kaye believed too much deference was provided to the trial court 's decision and was concerned that while the prosecutor expressed an interest in removing Spanish-speakers because of the interpreter there was no indication that any non-Latino jurors were asked if they spoke Spanish as well .
The Supreme Court granted a writ of certiorari to determine if a Latino juror struck from jury service because of their Spanish language in a court translated proceeding violated a defendant 's Batson protections .
Arguments at the Supreme Court
Amicus curiae
The Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund ( MALDEF ) filed an amicus curiae on behalf of Hernandez . MALDEF 's argument focused on the wide usage of Spanish by Hispanics and the sociolinguistic evidence that supported Hispanics as living in a world where they are constantly required to switch between Spanish and English without the ability to turn off the ability to speak either . It forecast that Hispanic jurors would become an `` endangered species '' if they are presumed to be biased , based on a common attribute .
Oral argument
At oral argument , Hernandez argued that it is a per se Batson violation to discriminate on language . Hernandez believed that every bilingual juror would express the same hesitance that the struck jurors in his case would because of their language ability . The Court was concerned with line drawing issues of potential multiple dialects or languages for a given foreign country and if a prosecutor could ever use a peremptory strike against a bilingual juror .
New York argued that Hernandez 's position was against Supreme Court jurisprudence for three main reasons : it uses the juror 's answer as proof of a prosecutor 's intent to discriminate , it prevents individualized assessment of jurors in favor of group stereotypes , and it would create no ability for prosecutors to excuse certain jurors .
Plurality decision
Justice Kennedy wrote the plurality opinion . After outlining the facts of the case and procedural history of the case , the Court moved on to the Court 's jurisprudence on Batson . It reiterated Batson 's three-step process : first , a defendant must make a prima facie case of racial discrimination , second , if it is made the burden shifts to the prosecutor to make a race-neutral showing for the strike , and finally the trial judge make a determination if the defendant 's claim stands . Even though Hernandez did not make a prima facie showing before the prosecutor presented a race-neutral reasoning , the Court found this did not impact the analysis because it rested with the trial judge 's determination .
The Court side-stepped Hernandez 's argument on the correlation between Spanish-speaking ability and ethnicity because of the additional factors the prosecutor articulated in his reasoning for striking the two Latino jurors . Kennedy argued that even assuming all bilingual speakers would hesitate it did not fail a race-neutral analysis because it does not show an intent by the prosecutor to remove all bilingual Latinos and a negative impact does not violate race neutrality .
The trial court 's decision is afforded a high level of deference under Batson , and the Court assumed that the trial judge took into account the case-specific factors in making the decision to accept the prosecutor 's justification : the high concentration of Spanish speakers in the local population , Spanish as the predominant language for many in that region , the ethnic backgrounds of the parties and witnesses , and the prosecutor 's swift justification . This level of deference was based on a trial judge 's ability to decide credibility questions that can not be reviewed solely through the record on the appeal . The plurality did not find any reason that the trial judge 's decision presented a clear error and was a permissible view under the evidence .
In a closing dicta discussion , the plurality cited linguistic studies noting the complexity of language and bilingual distinctions . It further counseled that excluding bilinguals is unwise and may be unconstitutional under a different set of facts . Specifically , Kennedy outlined that creating a blanket policy regardless of the case 's specific facts or for particular ethnic groups in certain communities language could be treated similarly to skin color under Batson . However , this was not that case .
Concurrence
Justices O'Connor and Scalia concurred in the plurality 's judgement . O'Connor agreed with the plurality 's deference to the trial court 's decision , but believed it went too far in deciding the constitutional question . After outlining the Court 's jurisprudence under Batson and Washington v. Davis , O'Connor limited the Equal Protection Clause analysis for racial discrimination to race only . `` No matter how closely tied or significantly correlated to race . . . [ it ] does not implicate the Equal Protection Clause unless it is based on race . '' O'Connor reasoned that if a trial judge accepted a prosecutor 's nonracial explanation , then there was nothing more for an appeals court to decide on a Batson claim .
Dissent
Justice Stevens dissented and Justice Marshall joined . Under Batson , Stevens argued that a prosecutor who attempts to rebut a prima facie showing of discrimination must do so with `` 'legitimate reasons ' that are 'related to the particular case to be tried . ' '' Stevens found the Court erred by allowing an illegitimate explanation for the prosecutor 's actions that went to the heart of Batson 's protections of the Fourteenth Amendment . Further , Stevens found that the prosecutor 's justification would disproportionately affect Spanish-speaking jurors , alternatives were available to address the prosecutor 's concerns , and his reasoning should be viewed skeptically because he did not use a for cause challenge .
Justice Blackmun dissented in a separate statement agreeing with Justice Stevens ' dissent on the prosecutor 's insufficient explanation for dispelling an inference of racial animus .
Criticism of the decision
The decision received immediate attention with a New York Times article that broke down the arguments and the court 's reasoning . Law professors were also skeptical of the decision and its implications . Professor Juan Perea argued that the interconnection between race and language is not properly addressed and that the Supreme Court should have found the prosecutor 's peremptory strikes not race-neutral . Professor Deborah Ramirez highlighted that this decision could permit bilinguals to systematically be removed from juries and the pervasiveimpact that may have on Latinos . Professor Alfredo Mirandé furthered this research on `` bilingualism as an immutable characteristic '' under Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection Doctrine and noted lower courts had expanded the Supreme Court 's reasoning to allow peremptory challenges when a juror understands a foreign language when the translation is disputed at trial .
The Supreme Court has not revisited the question of potential discrimination towards bilingual or multilingual jurors since which has created confusion for lower courts . An examination of twenty years after Hernandez v. New York in California courts found the case 's reasoning to be `` an arbitrary and flawed tool '' but California courts were hesitant to rule contrary . This has left open the question of how the Court would rule if non-Latinos who spoke Spanish were allowed to remain in a jury while Spanish speaking Latinos were struck because of their language ability . Professor Mirandé notes that Latinos across the board are hurt , monolingual Spanish speakers are barred because they lack English while bilingual jurors are struck because they know too much Spanish . He continues that instead bilingual Spanish speakers should be wanted by the court to play an important check on court translations . Another commentator has argued the courts should embrace more bilingualism because of the benefits it provides to the legal system as the Hernandez dissent discussed .
Aftermath of the decision
Five years later , the Supreme Court cited to Hernandez v. New York as outlining the Batson steps and what met the `` legitimate reason '' standard for a prosecutor to strike a juror . With the Supreme Court limiting the protections of Batson , states may be able to protect them on a state constitutional basis . Today , the case is understood to expand the Equal Protection Clause 's protections of an unbiased jury to apply to ethnic origin alongside Batson 's protections for race .
In a habeas corpus case , the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit acknowledged the close connection between language and race noting Kennedy remarked how language can lead to discrimination . However , it found language did not meet the same `` heightened '' or `` strict '' scrutiny that race and gender under equal protection doctrine . The Third Circuit did outline that Latino jurors could not be struck because of the theoretical use of Spanish and placed a greater burden on trial judges to be `` sensitive to the potential use of language-based peremptories for discriminatory purposes .

Nyashanu Mission is located in Buhera District , Manicaland Province , Zimbabwe in the area of Ishe Mabvuregudo ( local Chief ) in the local country of Mambo Nyashanu ( local King ) .
History of the mission
Makumbe mission under Ishe Makumbe ( Gambiza ) was the first station in Buhera District . The mission station was founded in 1909 by colonial white missionaries who were assisted by their colleagues at Dutch Reformed Church ( DRC ) run stations of Gutu Mission and Alheit Ching'ombe Mission . Support also came from the Dutch Reformed Church headquarters in Masvingo and South Africa and the Netherlands in Europe where the church originated . Makumbe Mission was established Reverend P. A. Badenhorst who had been transferred from Zimuto Mission and was a Reverend in the Dutch Reformed Church , a church of Boers who created apartheid in South Africa . A secondary school was opened at Makumbe in 1915 . This was followed by a teacher training school in 1950 , primary school and a high school . In 1954 , Makumbe mission assisted in the founding of Nyashanu Mission . The name of the missionary who helped start the station at Nyashanu in 1954 was probably Badenhorst but they were others .
The purpose of the missionaries was twofold . First , they were part of a larger scheme by white people to colonise Africa . Second , they were part of a religious movement that competed for growth of their church beliefs in Africa . The Dutch Reformed Church was one of them . Both purposes were motivated by the colonial belief that African ways of life should be replaced with white ways . But the hidden and main mission was to colonise the people in the area , and ultimately colonise Zimbabwe with the help of people like Cecil John Rhodes . For several years , the missionaries decimated African society , disrespected African ways of life and separated believers from their community . On a positive note , they contributed to development of education , agriculture and health . The first mission was Morgenster established by Andries Adriaan Louw in September 1891 . Louw was supported by the first group of colonisers known by white people as the pioneer column because initially Inkosi Lobengula has rejected their coming .
The facilities of the Reformed Church include :
Mabhuku ( bookshop )
Munyai Washe ( church magazine )
Murray Theological College
The Margaretha Hugo School for the Blind ( Copata )
Reformed Church University
Morgenster Mission ( founded 1891 )
Gutu Mission ( 1892 )
Chibi Mission ( 1894 )
Ngomahura Mission ( 1899 )
Pamushana ( 1901 )
Zimuto Mission ( 1904 )
Alheit Ching'ombe Mission ( 1906 )
Jichidza Mission ( 1908 )
Makumbe Mission ( 1914 )
Nyashanu Mission ( 1954 )
All the work they did was not possible without the work of Black evangelists and workers . For example , it was said :
To establish the church and the mission at Nyashanu , the missionaries were supported and approved by the Rhodesian colonial government through the sub-district Native Commissioner who was based at Buhera Office and the substantive Native Commissioner who has based at Charter near Chivhu . With this support , it was easy to get approval from local King Makiwa Nyashanu and local chief Mabvuregudo . They were given land far away from villages , near Mwerahari River and Masenga Mountain . At this point , the country King , Mambo Tohwechipi The Zimbabwe King , Rozvi Empire Dynasty ) had been deposed by the colonial regime , and was living near Mavengwe area between local King Makumbe and local King Nyashanu 's area . Tohwechipi was later killed around 1968 and his grave is a national monument protected by the National Monuments of Zimbabwe in Mavangwe Hills , Buhera . Tohwechipi became the last King of Zimbabwe .
Nyashanu Mission was the last Mission established by the Dutch Reformed Church in Zimbabwe before they handed over church assets to the African Reformed Church on 4 May 1977 as a result of the armed struggle . The white missionaries supported the white regime , so they found it hard to remain in Zimbabwe . They left Zimbabwe for South Africa . At independence in 1980 , the African Reformed Church changed its name to Reformed Church in Zimbabwe .
Mission services and infrastructure
The services at the mission include a clinic , a church , Nyashanu High School and Nyashanu Primary School . It is not yet clear when each of these started . The clinic is currently run with the assistance of the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare while the schools are run by the Reformed Church in Zimbabwe and assistance from the government . The main mission station has a clinic , a boarding high school ( forms 1-6 ) and church . The high school also enrols day scholars or non-boarders . The primary school is located about 1500 metres away from the main station and is not a boarding .
The infrastructure of the main station includes several classroom blocks disability resource centre ( visual impairment ) two laboratories , buildings for practical subjects , staff houses , dormitories , sports fields , a cattle pen , grazing paddocks , boreholes with water engines , water tanks , church building , mortuary , clinic building ( number of beds unknown ) , staff room , dining hall , garden , grinding mill , library , study centre , small shop , storage facilities , a road , grid electricity and a forest from where firewood is obtained .
Nyashanu High School
The school was run by white missionaries until they left in 1977 during the Second Chimurenga , the war of Zimbabwe 's liberation . At independence in 1980 , Mr Samson Mzilikazi Shava was appointed the new headmaster . He retired in 2013 to become for Education Secretary for the Reformed Church in Zimbabwe . in 2014 , Daniel Jeche became the next principal .
The school 's motto is vane shungu vachafara , meaning the motivated will prosper or be happy .
The school has four sports houses , and these are named in accordance of some houses of Nyashanu , the Mambo of the area . These houses are :
Mudawose ( Yellow colour )
Mufakose ( Green colour )
Muradzikwa ( Blue colour )
Dirikwi ( Red colour )
The school is known for academic excellence and sports achievement in Buhera District and in Zimbabwe and boasts an alumnus renowned in the country and globally .

In linguistic typology , split ergativity is a feature of certain languages where some constructions use ergative syntax and morphology , but other constructions show another pattern , usually nominative–accusative . The conditions in which ergative constructions are used varies among different languages .
Nominative–accusative vs. ergative–absolutive
Nominative–accusative languages ( including European languages , with the notable exception of Basque ) treat both the actor in a clause with a transitive verb and the experiencer in a clause with an intransitive verb in the same way grammatically . If the language uses case markers , they take the same case . If it uses word order , it is parallel .
For example , consider these two English sentences :
Jane was chasing John .
Jane was sweating .
The grammatical role of `` Jane '' is identical . In both cases , `` Jane '' is the subject .
In ergative–absolutive languages ( such as Basque and Georgian , or the Eskimo–Aleut and Mayan languages ) , there is a different pattern . The patient ( or target ) of a transitive verb and the experiencer of an intransitive verb are treated the same grammatically . If the two sentences above were expressed in an ergative language , `` John '' in the former and `` Jane '' in the latter would be parallel grammatically . Also , a different form ( the ergative ) would be used for `` Jane '' in the first sentence .
For example , in the following Inuktitut sentences , the subject 'the woman ' is in ergative case ( arnaup ) when occurring with a transitive verb , while the object 'the apple ' ( aapu ) is in absolutive case . In the intransitive sentence , the subject 'the woman ' arnaq is in absolutive case .
Arnaup nirijanga aapu . 'The woman is eating the apple . '
Arnaq pisuktuq . 'The woman is walking . '
In split ergative languages , some constructions pattern with nominative–accusative , and others with ergative–absolutive .
Split conditions
The split is usually conditioned by one of the following :
The presence of a discourse participant ( a first or second person ) in the proposition . The Australian language Dyirbal behaves ergatively in all morphosyntactic contexts unless one of those is involved . When a first- or second-person pronoun appears , however , it is marked according to a nominative–accusative pattern ( with the least-marked case , when it is the agent or intransitive , or with the most marked case , when it is the patient ) . That can be explained in terms of the high animacy of a first-person or second-person speaker in the animacy hierarchy .
The use of certain aspects and/or tenses in the verb . The Indo-Iranian family , for example , shows a split between the perfective and the imperfective aspect . In Hindustani ( Hindi-Urdu ) , a transitive verb in the perfective aspect causes its arguments to be marked by an ergative pattern , and the imperfective aspects trigger accusative marking .
The type of marking involved . Some languages ( including various Austronesian languages of New Guinea such as Sinaugoro ) have an ergative–absolutive pattern with respect to the marking of case marking but a nominative–accusative pattern with respect to agreement .
The agentivity of the intransitive subject . In languages like Dakota , arguments of active verbs , such as to run , are marked like transitive agents , as in accusative languages , but arguments of inactive verbs , such as to stand are marked like transitive objects , as in ergative languages . Languages with such a marking are known as split-S languages and are formally a subtype of active languages .
Pragmatic considerations or for emphasis , contrast , or clarity . In certain Tibeto-Burmese languages , elicited data has consistent ergative , aspectually split-ergative or active-stative case marking pattern , and in natural discourse the “ ergative ” marking is found only in some clauses , often a minority , usually with some pragmatic sense of emphasis or contrast ( DeLancey , 2011 ) .
Examples
Hindi–Urdu
An example of split ergativity conditioned by the grammatical aspect is found in Hindustani ( Hindi-Urdu ) ; in the perfective aspect of transitive verbs ( in active voice ) , the subject takes ergative case and the direct object takes an unmarked absolutive case identical to the nominative case , which is sometimes called direct case . However , in all other aspects ( habitual & progressive ) , subjects appear either in the direct/nominative case or dative case ( see dative subjects ) , while direct objects continue to appear in the direct case ( the subject of such sentences is differentiated from the direct object not from a difference in case but from the agreement of the verb with the subject as well as other syntactic and contextual cues such as word order and meaning ) .
In the following perfective sentence , the agent laṛke-ne ( boy ) is marked for ergative case , while the undergoer kitāb ( book ) is in unmarked nominative case . The verb kharīdī ( bought ) has the feminine ending -ī , showing gender agreement with the undergoer kitāb ( book ) .
In the corresponding imperfective ( habitual aspect ) sentence , the agent laṛkā ( boy ) is in unmarked nominative case . The habitual participle form kharīdatā ( buy ) has the masculine ending -ā and thus agrees with the agent laṛkā ( boy ) .
Perfective constructions with certain VV ( verb-verb ) complexes do not employ ergative case marking ( seeː light verbs in hindi-urdu ) . In perfective constructions , the agent argument is ideally assigned with an ergative case ; however in cases like the first example shown below that does not happen . This is because the explicator verb gayī ( gone ) which although undergoes semantic bleaching but still retains its intransitivity which does not allow for an ergative case assignment to the agent argument ( i.e. , ninā ) . This is why as shown in the second example below , VV complexes involving a transitive explicator verb ( e.g. , phẽkā `` threw '' ) can employ ergative case to agent arguments .
Chol ( Mayan )
The Mayan language Chol has split-ergative person marking .
In transitive clauses , verbs are framed by a person marking prefix ( called `` set A '' in Mayan linguistics ) that expresses the subject , and a suffix that expresses the object ( = `` set B '' ) .
In intransitive clauses , the subject can either be represented by a set A-person marker , or a set B-person marker , depending on aspect .
In perfective aspect , Chol has ergative–absolutive alignment : the subject of the intransitive verb is expressed by a suffixed person marker , thus in the same way as the object of transitive verbs .
In imperfective aspect , Chol has nominative–accusative alignment : the subject of the intransitive verb is expressed by a prefixed person marker , thus in the same way as the subject of transitive verbs .
Sahaptin
In Columbia River Sahaptin , the split is determined by the person of both subject and object . The ergative suffix -nɨm occurs only for third-person subjects for which the direct object is in the first or the second person .
Another ergative suffix , -in , marks the subject in the inverse . Both subject and object are then always in the third-person .
Direct ( same as above example ) :

Plot
Dr. Krishnan and his son Dr. Balan are dedicated to eradicating death by snake bite . They go on a mission to the dense forests surrounding the mountain ranges in search of the Thanka Sarpam or the Golden Snake , believed to be the most poisonous in the world . Their intention is to conduct research based on its venom and perhaps invent an anti-venom that would be a remedy for all snake bites . Their compounder also accompanies them . They stay in the forest guest house and the watcher there , Raghavan Pilllai , guides them in their search . But their efforts fail . Balan falls in love with Nagaprabha , the elder daughter of Swami , a hermit who lives in the forests along with his daughters and engaged in worshipping his family deity Nagamma , the Snake Goddess . The compounder falls in love with the younger daughter Nagalatha . One day , Balan and the compounder reach Swami 's hermitage and see the Thanka Sarpam on the idol of Nagamma inside the cave temple there . Balan and his father request Swami to hand the Thanka Sarpam to them and offer a huge sum of money . Swami becomes furious and drives them away . Meanwhile , Nagalatha is attacked by a bear and Krishnan 's attempts to save her fail .

Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church is a historic African Methodist Episcopal ( A.M.E. ) church located at 805 Monroe Street in Vicksburg , Mississippi . The church 's congregation was established in 1864 , making it the first A.M.E. church in the state . Its first church was a preexisting church building built in 1828 ; this was demolished to make way for the present building , which was completed in 1912 . The church has a Romanesque Revival design with an auditorium plan , a common style for church buildings built in Mississippi at the time . The building features a four-story tower on the north side topped by a crenellated pyramid roof , stained glass rose windows on three sides , and a cross gabled roof with a corbelled parapet .
The church was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 30 , 1992 .

The Challenge is a 1970 made-for-television movie starring Darren McGavin and Mako . Director George McCowan chose to hide his involvement by using the pseudonym Alan Smithee ( spelled Allen Smithee in the credits ) . This was the last film appearance of Paul Lukas .
Plot
An American orbital weapons platform crashes in an uninhabited area of the Pacific . An unnamed Asian country arrives first , but US naval forces block their escape from the area . The platform would allow any country to threaten the US from space . While the US has an overwhelming advantage in force , the country is allied with China , which the US does not want to aggravate . The Chinese government does not want to enter a full-scale war , but neither do they want to lose face . They agree to settle the matter with a `` surrogate '' war , fought by a single representative of each country . General Lewis Meyers is opposed to the proposal as he believes US forces can crush its adversaries .
American agents track down and bring back Jacob Gallery from a Latin American country , where he is a guide on a big game hunt . Meyers is familiar with Gallery , who was court-martialed during the Vietnam War for hunting Viet Cong sentries at night and keeping trophies of his kills . During one such unauthorized nightly expedition , his unit was wiped out while he was hunting alone . Meyers wants to send Bryant , a Marine captain who respects authority , but the Secretary wants to send someone whose disregard for rules and procedures is more likely to produce victory .
A small tropical island is selected for the battle , its inhabitants relocated to Guam . Gallery reluctantly agrees to the assignment after demanding $ 1 million in advance . He is put through a training program and given a selection of weapons , including a pair of Madsen submachine guns bolted together that fires regular ammunition and birdshot rounds . He is warned that the greatest threat on the island is fungi , which can quickly infect any wound . A former resident of the island advises Gallery on where to find fresh water .
Gallery is sent on his way from a surfaced submarine at the same time his adversary is sent . After his first encounter with Yuro , he sets up his base inside a hidden cave . He begins polluting the water sources , forcing Yuro to the last one . When Yuro goes to the pond , Gallery ambushes him . Yuro escapes , but not before being wounded . Gallery discovers Yuro 's treetop base and booby traps it with a grenade . But Yuro had set razor blades in the tree trunk , one of which cuts Gallery 's leg .
On the submarine , Meyers arrives and unveils his plan to secretly send in Bryant since Gallery has not been successful after four days .
In the now-abandoned village , a feverish Gallery sets traps , but Yuro gets the drop on him . Gallery barely escapes and makes his way to the beach with Yuro in pursuit . Hearing his name , he peeks around rocks to see Bryant holding Yuro at gunpoint . Bryant tells Gallery to kill Yuro and be a hero , but a disgusted Gallery shoots Bryant instead . Yuro runs off .
Making his way back to his cave , Gallery comes upon one of Yuro 's countrymen , hanging dead in one of Yuro 's tree snares , signaling betrayal from both countries . Resting in his cave , he hears Yuro beseeching him to forsake the treacherous country that sent a second man against the rules . Yuro offers to save Gallery from his festering wound , but is pointing his gun at the cave . Gallery empties his magazine into the greenery , killing Yuro . He takes out his transmitter to proclaim victory , but decides against it , throwing it away before succumbing to his infection .

Production
This made-for-television film was made at the height of the Vietnam war . Critic Steven Puchalski suggests the film was an allegory for that conflict . The original director , Joseph Sargent , left the production after conflicts with the producer during editing . George McCowan took over the direction . Says Puchalski , `` it 's hard to understand why [ he decided to use the Allen Smithee pseudonym ] in this case , since The Challenge is actually a tightly-wound lesson about the stupidity and futility of warfare .

The national flag of Belarus is a vertically bisected red-and-green flag with a white-and-red ornament pattern placed at the hoist ( staff ) end . The current design was introduced in 2012 by the State Committee for Standardisation of the Republic of Belarus , and is adapted from a design approved in a May 1995 referendum . It is a modification of the 1951 flag used while the country was a republic of the Soviet Union . Changes made to the Soviet-era flag were the removal of communist symbols – the hammer and sickle and the red star – as well as the reversal of the colours in the ornament pattern . Since the 1995 referendum , several flags used by Belarusian government officials and agencies have been modelled on this national flag .
Historically , the white-red-white flag was used by the Belarusian People 's Republic in 1918 before Belarus became a Soviet Republic , then by the Belarusian national movement in West Belarus followed by widespread unofficial use during the Nazi occupation of Belarus between 1942 and 1944 , and again after it regained its independence in 1991 until the 1995 referendum . Opposition groups have continued to use this flag , though its display in Belarus has been restricted by the government of Belarus , which claims it is linked with Nazi collaboration due to its use by Belarusian collaborators during World War II . The white-red-white flag has been used in protests against the government , most recently the 2020–2021 Belarusian protests , and by the Belarusian diaspora .
Design
The basic design of the national flag of Belarus was first described in Presidential Decree No . 214 of 7 June 1995 . The flag is a rectangular cloth consisting of two horizontal stripes : a red upper stripe covering two-thirds of the flag 's height , and green lower stripe covering one-third . A vertical red-on-white traditional Belarusian decorative pattern , which occupies one-ninth of the flag 's length , is placed against the flagstaff . The flag 's ratio of width to length is 1:2 .
The flag does not differ significantly from the flag of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic ( Byelorussian SSR ) , other than the removal of the hammer and sickle and the red star , as well as the reversal of red and white in the hoist pattern , from white-on-red to red-on-white . While there is no official interpretation for the colours of the flag , an explanation given by President Alexander Lukashenko is that red represents freedom and the sacrifice of the nation 's forefathers , while green represents life .
In addition to the 1995 decree , `` STB 911-2008 : National Flag of the Republic of Belarus '' was published by the State Committee for Standardisation of the Republic of Belarus in 2008 . It gives the technical specifications of the national flag , such as the details of the colours and the ornament pattern . The red ornament design on the national flag was , until 2012 , the width of the flag , and with the white margin . As of 2012 , the red pattern has occupied the whole of the white margin ( which stayed at ) .
Colours
The colours of the national flag are regulated in `` STB 911-2008 : National Flag of the Republic of Belarus '' and are listed in the CIE Standard illuminant D65 .

Hoist ornament pattern
A decorative pattern , designed in 1917 by , is displayed on the hoist of the flag ( as it was previously , on the 1951 flag ) . The pattern , derived from local plants and flowers , is a traditional type commonly used in Belarus . These patterns are sometimes used in woven garments , most importantly in the traditional ruchnik , a woven cloth used for ceremonial events like religious services , funerals , and other more minor social functions , such as a host offering guests bread and salt served on a ručnik .
The husband of Matrona Markevich was arrested for anti-Soviet propaganda and executed during Soviet repression in Belarus in 1937 , after which the family was dekulakised . The original ruchnik has not survived and was either confiscated by the NKVD in 1937 or destroyed during World War II . The brother of Matrona Markevich , Mikhail Katsar , head of the ethnography and folklore department at the Academy of Sciences of Belarus , was included into the commission that was ordered to create a new flag for the Belarusian SSR in 1951 . A monument to Matrona Markevich was erected in Sianno in 2015 .
Flag protocol
Belarusian law requires that the flag be flown daily , weather permitting , from the following locations :
The residence of the President of Belarus
The buildings of the National Assembly of Belarus ( House of Representatives and Council of the Republic )
The building of the Council of Ministers of Belarus
Courts of Belarus
Offices of local executive and administrative bodies
Above buildings in which sessions of local Councils of deputies take place ( during the meetings )
Military bases or military ships
Belarusian embassies and consulates
At checks points and posts at the borders of Belarus
The Belarusian flag is also officially flown on the sites of special occasions :
Sessions of local executive and administrative bodies
Voting/polling places
Sports arenas during competitions ( although the IOC has its own rules on flag display )
Belarusian diplomats and various government officials ( such as the President and the Prime Minister ) display the flag on vehicles . On special occasions , such as memorial services and family holidays , and it can be used at ceremonies and events hosted by public organisations , companies , and NGOs . The regulations were issued in the same decree that defined the Belarusian flag . The national flag has been incorporated into the badge of the guard units in the Belarusian armed forces . The pole should be three times longer than the width of the flag .
According to the 1995 presidential decree , the national flag is to be used on a staff that is coloured gold ( ochre ) . Other parts of the protocol specify the finial ( the metal ornament on a flag pole ) as diamond-shaped and coloured in a yellow metal . In this diamond there is a five-pointed star ( similar to that used in the national emblem ) . The diamond pattern represents another continuation of Soviet flag traditions . The Day of the National Emblem and Flag of Belarus is 15 May .
Historical flags
White-red-white flag
The white-red-white flag was used by the Belarusian People 's Republic in 1918 before Belarus became a Soviet Republic , then by the Belarusian national movement in West Belarus followed by widespread unofficial use during the Nazi occupation of Belarus between 1942 and 1944 , and again after it regained its independence in 1991 until the 1995 referendum .
Opposition groups have continued to use this flag , though its display in Belarus has been restricted by the government of Belarus , which claims it is linked with Nazi collaboration due to its use by Belarusian collaborators during World War II . The white-red-white flag has been used in protests against the government , most recently the 2020–2021 Belarusian protests , and by the Belarusian diaspora .
Soviet era
1919–1951
Before 1951 , several different flags had been in use since the Revolution . The earliest flag was plain red , and was used in 1919 during the existence of the Lithuanian–Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic . After the formation of the Byelorussian SSR , the lettering ССРБ ( SSRB ) was added in gold to the top hoist . This design was established with the passage of the first Constitution of the Byelorussian SSR . It was later modified in the 1927 Constitution where the letters were changed to БССР ( BSSR ) but kept the overall design the same . This design was changed in 1937 , when a hammer and sickle and red star were placed above the letters . The flag dimensions were also formally established as 1:2 for the first time . This flag remained in use until the adoption of the 1951 flag , which did away with the letters .
1951–1991
The flag of the Byelorussian SSR was adopted by decree on 25 December 1951 . The flag was slightly modified in 1956 when construction details were added for the red star and the golden hammer and sickle . The final specifications of the flag was set in Article 120 of the Constitution of the Byelorussian SSR and are very similar to the current Belarusian flag . The flag had a length-to-width ratio of one to two ( 1:2 ) , just like the flag of the Soviet Union ( and the other fourteen union republics ) . The main portion of the flag was red ( representing the Revolution ) , with the rest being green ( representing the Belarusian forests ) . A pattern of white drawn on red decorated the hoist portion of the flag ; this design is often used on Belarusian traditional costumes . In the upper corner of the flag , in the red portion , a gold hammer and sickle was added , with a red star outlined in gold above it . The hammer represented the worker , and the sickle the peasant ; according to Soviet ideology , these two symbols crossed together symbolised co-operation between the two classes . The red star , a symbol commonly used by Communist parties , was said to stand either for the five social groups ( workers , youth , peasants , military , and academics ) , the five known continents , or the five fingers of the worker 's hand . The hammer , sickle and star were sometimes not displayed on the reverse of the flag . The purpose for this design was that the Byelorussian SSR , along with the Soviet Union and the Ukrainian SSR , were admitted to the United Nations in 1945 as founding members and needed distinct flags for each other . The designer of the flag was Mikhail Gusyev .
1995 referendum
The referendum that was held to adopt the state symbols took place on 14 May 1995 . With a voter turnout of 64.7 % , the new flag was approved by a majority in the ratio of three to one ( 75.1 % to 24.9 % ) . The other three questions were also passed by the voters . The way of carrying out the referendum as well as the legality of questioning the national symbols on a referendum was heavily criticised by the opposition . Opposition parties claimed that only 48.7 % of the entire voting population ( 75.1 % of the 64.7 % who showed at the polling stations ) supported the adoption of the new flag , but Belarusian law ( as in many other countries ) states that only a majority of voters is needed to decide on a referendum issue . Upon the results going in favor of President Lukashenko , he proclaimed that the return of the Soviet-style flag brought a sense of youth and pleasant memories to the nation .
Lukashenko had tried to hold a similar referendum before , in 1993 , but failed to get parliamentary support . Two months before the May 1995 referendum , Lukashenko proposed a flag design that consisted of two small bars of green and one wide bar of red . While it is not known what became of this suggestion , new designs ( called `` projects '' in Belarus ) were suggested a few days later , which were then put up to vote in the 1995 referendum .
Other related flags
Since the introduction of the 1995 flag , several other flags adopted by government agencies or bodies have been modelled on it .
The presidential standard , which has been in use since 1997 , was adopted by a decree called `` Concerning the Standard of the President of Republic of Belarus '' . The standard 's design is an exact copy of the national flag , with the addition of the Belarusian national emblem in gold and red . The standard 's ratio of 5:6 differs from that of the national flag , making the standard almost square . It is used at buildings and on vehicles to denote the presence of the president .
In 2001 , President Lukashenko issued a decree granting a flag to the Armed Forces of Belarus . The flag , which has a ratio of 1:1.7 , has the national ornamental pattern along the length of the hoist side of the flag . On the front of the flag is the Belarusian coat of arms , with the wording УЗБРОЕНЫЯ СІЛЫ ( `` Armed Forces '' ) arched over it , and РЭСПУБЛІКІ БЕЛАРУСЬ ( `` of Republic of Belarus '' ) written below ; the text of both is in gold . On the reverse of the flag , the centre contains the symbol of the armed forces , which is a red star surrounded by a wreath of oak and laurel . Above the symbol is the phrase ЗА НАШУ РАДЗІМУ ( `` For our Motherland '' ) , while below is the full name of the military unit .

Hermodorus ( ) , an Ephesian who lived in the 4th century BC , was an original member of Plato 's Academy and was present at the death of Socrates . He is said to have circulated the works of Plato ( combined Socratic tenets with the Eleaticism of Parmenides ) , and to have sold them in Sicily . Hermodorus himself appears to have been a philosopher , for we know the titles of two works that were attributed to him : On Plato ( ) , and On Mathematics ( ) .
A.E . Taylor says : Hermodorus , an original member of Plato 's Academy , stated that for the moment the friends of Socrates felt themselves in danger just after his death , and that Plato in particular , with others , withdrew for a while to the neighbouring city of Megara under the protection of Euclides of that city , a philosopher who was among the foreign friends present at the death of Socrates and combined certain Socratic tenets with the Eleaticism of Parmenides .

Aeroflot Flight 902 was a passenger flight on a scheduled domestic service from Khabarovsk to Moscow , with intermediate stops at Irkutsk and Omsk , Russia . The flight was operated by a Tu-104A aircraft . On 30 June 1962 , with 76 passengers ( including 14 children ) and 8 crew members aboard , the flight departed Irkutsk on schedule , and made a timely report 50 kilometers from Krasnoyarsk . A few minutes later , an agitated voice later identified as that of the co-pilot made an incoherent emergency transmission with a background of an unusual noise . Repeated subsequent attempts to contact the flight failed .
The aircraft 's wreckage was found 28 km east of Krasnoyarsk Airport , in flat terrain with small areas of forest . Investigators subsequently determined that the plane had impacted the ground upside-down at an angle of 40° . There were no survivors .
Cause of disaster
The official cause of the disaster was reported to be a stall and loss of spatial orientation in cloud . A second theory was a loss of control due to a fire in the passenger cabin . However , damage found on the port side of the fuselage ( specifically , an entry hole with signs of fire damage on the inside ) was consistent with damage from an anti-aircraft missile , and there was unofficial confirmation that such a missile had gone astray during an air defense exercise in the area .
Unofficial sources indicated that a fragment of the fuselage was found with a 20 cm hole and fire damage , indicating a high-speed impact . At the time of the crash , a unit at nearby Magansk had fired anti-aircraft missiles as part of an exercise . The responsible missile had allegedly lost its intended target in a storm front before hitting the Tu-104 .

In computer science , a monoculture is a community of computers that all run identical software . All the computer systems in the community thus have the same vulnerabilities , and , like agricultural monocultures , are subject to catastrophic failure in the event of a successful attack .
Overview
With the global trend of increased usage and reliance on computerized systems , some vendors supply solutions that are used throughout the industry ( such as Microsoft Windows ) - this forms algorithmic monocultures . Monocultures form naturally since they utilize economies of scale , it is cheaper to manufacture and distribute a single solution . Furthermore , by being used by a large community bugs are discovered relativity fast .
Like agricultural monocultures , algorithmic monocultures are not diverse , thus susceptible to correlated failures - a failure of many parts participating in the monoculture . In complete non-monocultures , where the outcome of all components are mutually independent thus un-correlated , the chance of catastrophic event ( failure of all the parts in the monoculture ) is the multiplication of each component failure probability ( exponentially decreasing ) .
On the other end , perfect monocultures are completely correlated , thus have a single point of failure . This means that the chance of a catastrophic event is constant - the failure probably of the single component .
Examples
Since operating systems are used in almost every workstation they form monocultures . For example Dan Geer has argued that Microsoft is a monoculture , since a majority of the overall number of workstations connected to the Internet are running versions of the Microsoft Windows operating system , many of which are vulnerable to the same attacks .
Large monocultures can also arise from software libraries , for example the Log4Shell exploit in the popular Log4j library estimated to affect hundreds of millions of devices .
Internet applications have also been shown to suffer from software monoculture .
Individual level concerns
The concept is significant when discussing computer security and viruses , the main threat is exposure to security vulnerabilities . Since monocultures are not diverse , any vulnerability found exists in all the individual members of the monoculture increasing the risk of exploitation . An example to that is exploited Wednesday in which after Windows security patches are released there is an increase exploitation events on not updated machines .
Clifford Stoll wrote in 1989 after dealing with the Morris worm :
Another main concern is increased spread of algorithmic bias . In the light of increased usage of machine learning there is a growing awareness of the biases introduced by algorithms . The nature of monocultures exacerbates this problem since it makes the bias systemic and spreading unfair decisions .
Social level concerns
Monocultures may lead to Braess 's like paradoxes in which introducing a `` better option '' ( such as a more accurate algorithm ) leads to suboptimal monocultural convergence - a monoculture whose correlated nature results in degraded overall quality of the decisions . Since monocultures form in areas of high-stakes decisions such as credit scoring and automated hiring , it is important to achieve optimal decision making .
This scenario can be studied throw the lens of mechanism design , in which agents are choosing between a set of algorithms , some of which return correlated outputs . The overall impact of the decision making is measured by social welfare .
Suboptimal monocultures convergence in automated hiring
This section demonstrates the concern of suboptimal monoculture convergence using automated hiring as a case study . Hiring is the process of ranking a group of candidates and hiring the top-valued . In recent years automated hiring ( automatically ranking candidates based on their interaction with an AI powered system ) became popular .
As shown by Kleinberg , under some assumptions , suboptimal automated hiring monocultures naturally form , namely , choosing the correlated algorithm is a dominant strategy , thus converging to monoculture that leads suboptimal social welfare .
Framework
In this scenario we will consider two firms and a group of candidate with hidden utilities of . For hiring process - each firm will produce a noisy-ranking of the candidates , then each firm ( in a random order ) hires the first available candidate in their ranking . Each firm can choose to use either an independent human ranker or use a common algorithmic ranking .
The ranking algorithm is modeled as a noisy distribution above permutations of parametrized by an accuracy parameter .
In order for to make sense it should satisfy these conditions :
Differentiability : The probability of each permutation is continues and differentiable in
Asymptotic optimality : For the true ranking :
Monotonicity : The expected utility of the top-ranked candidate gets better as increases , even if any subset of is removed .
These conditions state that a firm should always prefer higher values of , even if it is not first in the selection order .
Both the algorithmic and human ranking methods are of the form of and differ by the accuracy parameters . The algorithmic ranking output is corotated - it always outputs the same permutation . In contrast , a human ranked premutation is drawn from independently for each of firms .
For strategies of the first and second firm , Social welfare is defied as the sum of utilities of the hired candidates .
Conditions to suboptimal convergence
The Braess 's like paradox in this framework is suboptimal monocultures converges . That is , using the algorithmic ranking is dominant strategy thus converging toward monoculture yet it yields suboptimal welfare ( welfare in a world without algorithmic ranking is higher ) .
The main theorem proved by Kleinberg of this model is that for any and any noisy ranking family that satisfy these conditions :
Preference for the first position : For all if then .
Preference for weaker competition : For all .
there exists a such that both firms prefer using the sherd algorithmic ranking even though the social welfare is higher when both use the human evaluators . In other words - regardless of the accuracy of the human rankers there exists a more accurate algorithm whose introduction leads to suboptimal monoculture convergence .
The implications of this theorem is that under these conditions , firms will choose to use the algorithmic ranking even though that the correlated nature of algorithmic monocultures degrades total social welfare . Even though algorithmic rankings are more accurate .
The first condition on ( Preference for the first position ) is equivalent to a preference of firms to have independent ranking ( in our setting - non algorithmic ) . This means that a firm should prefer independent ranking methods given all else is equal .
The intuition behind preference for weaker competition is that when a candidate is removed ( hired by a different firm ) , the best remaining candidate is better in expectation when the removed candidate is chosen based on a less accurate ranking . Thus , a firm should always prefer that its competitors would be less accurate .
These conditions are met for that is the Mallows Model distributions and some types of random utility models ( Gaussian or Laplacian noise ) .

The Sikanni Chief River , is a river in the Northern Rocky Mountains region of the northern interior of British Columbia , Canada . Its headwaters are near Mount McCusker , northeast of the head of the Finlay Arm of Williston Lake . It joins the Fontas River to form the Fort Nelson River southeast of the town of Fort Nelson . However , among the local population the Fontas is viewed only as a tributary of the Sikinni Chief , in the view that the Sikanni continues to exist , flowing northwest to where it meets the larger Muskwa River where the Fort Nelson River is actually formed in the eyes of the indigenous Dene , Cree and European-descendant populations of Fort Nelson First Nation and Fort Nelson .

BIMARU ( Hindi : बीमारू Bīmārū ) is an acronym formed from the first letters of the names of the Indian states of Bihar , Madhya Pradesh , Rajasthan , and Uttar Pradesh . It was coined by Ashish Bose in the mid-1980s . BIMARU has a resemblance to a Hindi word bīmār ( बीमार ) meaning `` sick '' . This was used to refer to the poor economic conditions within those states . Several studies , including those by the UN , showed that the performance of the BIMARU states were dragging down the GDP growth rate of India . During the period of 2008–2011 , some of these states started to develop faster than some of the major states and the concept of BIMARU was being considered to be outdated . However , in the recent years , this concept has reemerged due to faltering growth rates of the states .
The present-day states of Chhattisgarh , Jharkhand and Uttarakhand were part of Madhya Pradesh , Bihar and Uttar Pradesh , respectively , at the time the BIMARU acronym was coined .
Historical background
In the mid-1980s , economic analyst Ashish Bose coined an acronym BIMARU , in a paper submitted to then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi . Several studies , including those by the UN , showed that the performance of the BIMARU states affected the GDP growth rate of India .
Recent developments
In recent times some of these states have seen real push in terms of economic growth . Although , some of these states have experienced high growth rates , they still lag other more developed states . Bihar 's GSDP grew by 80 % over the period 2006–2007 , which was higher than in the past 2 years and one of the highest recorded by the Government of India for that period . They have laid greater emphasis on education and learning by appointing more teachers and opening a software park . People from Bihar , Uttar Pradesh contribute significantly to ARMY , C.I.S.F , B.S.F , N.S.G , I.A.F and many other Para military forces because of their large young population in India . Recently these states are working for their improvement by developing infrastructures , IT-parks and giving a better invitation to the businessmen for investment . Also Madhya Pradesh enlisted at second position in U.N.O . GDP development ranking 's with a record of 225 % .
Population growth
The BIMARU states have some of the highest fertility rates in India . In 2010 , the total fertility rate was 3.9 for Bihar , 3.5 for Uttar Pradesh , 3.2 for Madhya Pradesh , and 3.1 for Rajasthan , compared to 2.5 for India as a whole . This leads to high population growth in these states than rest of India .
Literacy rates
The literacy rates in these states according to the 2011 census are Bihar 63.8 % , Rajasthan 67.1 % , Jharkhand 67.6 % , Madhya Pradesh 70.6 % and Uttar Pradesh 71.7 % against a national average of 74.04 % . While they trail the national average in the current literacy rate , they are registering very healthy growth rates in literacy comfortably outpacing states like Andhra Pradesh ( 67.7 % ) and Chhattisgarh ( 71 % ) , which have comparable literacy levels ( the exception being Rajasthan ) .
A recent survey by National University of Educational Planning and Administration ( UNEPA ) has determined that only 21 % of all primary school teachers in Bihar and 12.8 % in UP are Matriculates or lower .
Renowned educationists have asked for a complete overhaul of the educational system , particularly at the primary level .
Health care
The life expectancy in BIMARU states is lower than other Indian states . In fact , it is lower than the average life expectancy of India as a whole , implying that these states bring down the overall average as a whole .
Economic growth
Corruption remains one of the key factors reflecting poverty levels throughout the world and these states generally fare worse in the corruption indexes usually published .
It is one of the enigmas that in spite of the large representation in the parliament , these states could not get adequate resources for their development .
Another factor determining the BIMARU states ' economic situation is the lack of investment in irrigation and flood control . In spite of the highest incidence of floods in this region , the investment to manage this has been rather meager . Even though the socialist era in India was known for large infrastructure projects , the most modern irrigation system of Bihar is the British built Son Command Canal System which was opened for use in the 1890s . This is in sharp contrast to projects like Bhakra Nangal Dam in Punjab .
Yet another factor is the lack of perspective in the planning exercise . For example , even though large portions of the national highway schemes : the Golden Quadrilateral and the East West corridor pass through the so-called BIMARU states , its alignment would not serve the population of these states . Let alone the main alignment , there is no provision even for by-passes to serve towns such as Ranchi , Patna , Dhanbad , Gaya or Jamshedpur .
Since 2000 , there has also been a change in the geographic composition of these states , with Bihar being bifurcated into Bihar and Jharkhand ; Madhya Pradesh being bifurcated into Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh ; and Uttar Pradesh being bifurcated into Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand .

Acid grassland is a nutrient-poor habitat characterised by grassy tussocks and bare ground .
Habitat
The vegetation is dominated by grasses and herbaceous plants , growing on soils deficient in lime ( calcium ) . These may be found on acid sedimentary rock such as sandstone ; acid igneous rock such as granite ; and fluvial or glacial deposits such as sand and gravel . Typical plants of lowland acid grassland in Britain include common bent grass , Agrostis capillaris , wavy hair-grass , Deschampsia flexuosa , bristle bent grass , Agrostis curtisii , tormentil , Potentilla erecta , and flowers such as sheep 's sorrel , Rumex acetosella and heath bedstraw , Galium saxatile .
In Britain
In Britain , under 30,000 hectares of lowland acid grassland remain , often on common land and nature reserves . It is considered a nationally important habitat ; areas are found in London on freely-draining sandy and gravelly soils . 271 Sites of Special Scientific Interest have been notified with acid grassland as a principal reason for the designation . Greater London 's Richmond Park , Epping Forest and Wimbledon Common are all Special Areas of Conservation with considerable areas of acid grassland .

Controversy
Date of birth
In 2014 , the singer sued the Wikimedia Foundation , Wikipedia parent foundation , and Google , claiming that the sites spread false information and offensive facts to her honor in her biography , such as a supposedly wrong date of birth . As a result of an injunction granted to Rosanah , access to her article in Portuguese Wikipedia was publicly unavailable for almost two years . In 2012 , the singer had already considered prosecuting Google before because search results indicated pages that gave her an age she claimed wrong .
During Rosanah 's public career , several divergent claims were published about her date of birth . In 1987 , Veja magazine stated that the singer was 25 years old ( born 1961 or 1962 ) . In 1999 , Istoé Gente magazine stated that Rosanah was 36 years old ( born 1962 or 1963 ) . According to the artist 's record in the Cravo Albin Dictionary of Brazilian Popular Music , she would have been born in 1963 . In 2008 , Globo.com published a video clip of the singer that supposedly would have been aired on Fantástico in 1978 . The recording features Rosanah at the end of puberty .
In 2010 , EGO magazine reported that singer was 56 years old and in the same year , the magazine published `` Spending sensuality at the age of 42- an age that she made a point of correcting after misunderstanding with a search site that had published 56 '' . In 2012 , Fienngo stated in an interview that she was 44 years old and that she was born in 1968 . In the same year , a discrepancy was verified on the singer 's date of birth , since most documents submitted to the Supreme Electoral Court ( TSE ) for her candidacy for Rio de Janeiro councilor in the 2012 elections say that Rosanah was born in 1954 , but her Cadastro de Pessoa Física ( CPF ) states the year 1968 . In 2016 , Rosanah asked the TSE to rectify her date of birth on the website DivulgaCand .
On September 14 , 2016 , the article on the singer on Wikipedia was restored after a decision favorable to Wikimedia . On October 6 of the same year , her lawyers appealed the decision . However , in July 2017 , Rosanah lost the case that moved , because the Court of Rio de Janeiro understood that neither Google nor Wikipedia were responsible for the information . In the decision , Judge Márcia Cunha of the 21st Civil Chamber stated that the artist 's age had been taken from the TSE database , since she was a candidate for Rio de Janeiro councilor .

Abu ' l-Fadl Ja'far ibn al-Fadl ibn al-Furat ( ; 1001 ) , also called Ibn Hinzaba , like his father before him , was a member of the bureaucratic Banu ' l-Furat family from Iraq . A highly educated man renowned for his strict piety and knowledge of traditions about the early Islamic times , he served as vizier of the Ikhshidids of Egypt from 946 until the end of the dynasty in 969 , and continued serving the Fatimid Caliphate after that .
Following the death of Abu ' l-Misk Kafur in April 968 , Ibn al-Furat was left as one of the most powerful leaders in the country . His lack of support outside the bureaucracy and his inability to restore orderly administration and security in a country plagued by years of famine and external attacks , mean that his position was weak and constantly challenged by other factions , especially the military . He was deposed and imprisoned by al-Hasan ibn Ubayd Allah ibn Tughj in November 968 , but released and restored to his office when Hasan suddenly abandoned Egypt in February 969 and returned to Palestine . Ibn al-Furat remained vizier merely because no-one could agree on his replacement ; faced with the impasse , the Egyptian elites , influenced by long and persistent Fatimid propaganda , began to accept and even seek the prospect of a Fatimid takeover of the country . During the Fatimid conquest of Egypt in June 969 , Ibn al-Furat offered no resistance and merely supervised negotiations with the Fatimid general Jawhar .
Jawhar kept Ibn al-Furat in office as head of the administration , but he was dismissed after Caliph al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah arrived in Egypt in 973 .
Family and character
Abu ' l-Fadl Ja'far ibn al-Furat was born in 921 , the scion of a bureaucratic dynasty , the Banu ' l-Furat , that had occupied senior posts in the fiscal bureaucracy of the Abbasid Caliphate at Baghdad since the reign of Caliph al-Mu'tadid ( ) and had gone on to become one of the two major factions within the Abbasid administrative elite in the first decades of the 10th century . Ibn al-Furat 's father was al-Fadl ibn al-Furat ( died 938 ) , who had held several posts in the fiscal ministries of the Abbasid Caliphate , and had served as vizier for a few months in 932 and in 937 , before retiring to Egypt , ruled since 935 by Muhammad ibn Tughj al-Ikhshid .
Ibn al-Furat himself became tied to the Ikhshidid dynasty by his marriage to an Ikhshidid princess , while his sister had married the one-time Abbasid generalissimo ( amir al-umara ) Muhammad ibn Ra'iq , and their son Muzahim , originally held as a hostage in the Ikhshidid court , had become a senior commander in the Ikhshidid army and also married an Ikhshidid princess .
Ibn al-Furat was known for his piety and strict moral principles , which he imposed on his relatives , and which earned him the support of the religious circles . His piety was also expressed through his cultivation of the ashraf : every year he sent gifts of money to the Alid families of Mecca and Medina , and purchased a plot of land in the latter city where he intended to be buried . This in turn gave him the backing of the ashraf in Egypt , and especially of their leader , Abu Ja'far Muslim , a close personal friend . He was also esteemed for his deep knowledge about traditions concerning the Prophet Muhammad , so that the leading hadith scholar of the time , the Iraqi al-Daraqutni , came from Baghdad to consult with him . As the historian of the vizierate , Dominique Sourdel , writes , Ibn al-Furat `` left behind him the reputation of a generous patron of poets and scholars [ ... ] but also that of an eccentric who had acquired a collection of snakes and scorpions which terrified his neighbours '' .
Career
Ibn al-Furat became vizier in 946 , succeeding his father 's old political rival , Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Ali al-Madhara ' i . Ibn al-Furat held the post continuously under the Ikhshidid emirs Unujur ( ) and Ali ( ) , as well as under Abu al-Misk Kafur , the strongman who , after having long served as the power being the throne , became emir in his own right from 966–968 .
Crisis of the Ikhshidid regime , 968–969
After Kafur 's death in April 968 , the various factions initially agreed on a pact to share power under the nominal rule of al-Ikhshid 's eleven-year-old grandson , Abu ' l-Fawaris Ahmad ibn Ali , as emir . Ibn al-Furat , by virtue of his office , was the leader of the civilian bureaucratic faction . In alliance with the commander-in-chief Shamul , Ibn al-Furat seemed set to secure the role of regent over the under-age ruler , while as the husband of an Ikhshidid princess , he could hope to possibly place his own son , Ahmad , on the throne . Nevertheless , the new regime was unstable : Ibn al-Furat lacked a power-base outside the bureaucracy , Fatimid agents stirred up trouble among the Bedouin in Syria , the army was divided into mutually antagonistic factions ( chiefly the Ikhshidiyya , recruited by al-Ikhshid , and the Kafuriyya , recruited by Kafur ) , and the treasury was empty due to a series of low Nile floods that had caused an unprecedented famine .
Ibn al-Furat was quickly confronted with his inability to impose his authority : the military chiefs withheld the revenue due to the central treasury from their fiefs ( iqta ) , and were soon emulated by the regional fiscal officials . To find money , the vizier was thus forced to impose fines on other high officials , 4,500 gold dinars on Ya'qub ibn Killis , and 10,000 dinars on the Christian Ibrahim ibn Marwan , secretary of al-Ikhshid 's sons . Left unpaid , the Turkish ghilman rioted , and on 29 August 968 , the mutinous troops sacked his own palace , forcing Ibn al-Furat to go into hiding . A few days later , the sharif Abu Ja'far Muslim gathered the highest officials and military commanders in his home , and effected a reconciliation with Ibn al-Furat , by having him appear before them dressed in the formal costume of Kafur ; moved by the sight , Ibn al-Furat 's rivals agreed to support him . Ibn al-Furat then led the Friday prayer , before going to pay his respects to the widow of Ali ibn al-Ikhshid , the grandmother of the young emir , thus implicitly disavowing any designs of placing his own son on the throne .
Nevertheless , the situation remained difficult : financial problems persisted , and Ibn al-Furat remained unable to restore the overland Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca , a key demand of the religious class . This impasse led to a growing willingness to accept any solution , even a foreign intervention . The Fatimid agents in Fustat , led by the merchant Abu Ja'far Ahmad ibn Nasr , worked to exploit the situation , win the support , or at least passive acceptance , of the elites and the common people alike . Dissension was sown among the elites in order to prevent any rapprochement between the Ikhshidiyya and the Kafuriyya , while some of Ibn al-Furat 's rivals were encouraged to defect to the Fatimids ; most prominent among them being Ibn Killis , who provided the Fatimids with valuable information on the situation in Egypt .
Amidst this chaos , some in the ruling circles turned to al-Hasan ibn Ubayd Allah , an older cousin of the emir and governor of Palestine , for help . Al-Hasan was facing problems of his own : a Qarmatian army had invaded the Ikhshidid territories , defeated al-Hasan , and forced him to agree to the payment of a heavy tribute of 300,000 gold dinars . With his position in Palestine endangered , in need of money , and encouraged by the continued instability in Fustat , al-Hasan resolved to return to Egypt . Without facing any opposition , al-Hasan made a triumphal entrance into Fustat on 28 November , accompanied by Ibn al-Furat . He was immediately recognized as the regent and co-ruler of the young emir , and took up residence in the palace . Three days later he imprisoned Ibn al-Furat and a number of his associates , and imposed fines so heavy on them that Ibn al-Furat was forced to sell some of his properties to pay them .
Al-Hasan moved one step further to the throne when he married his cousin Fatima , a daughter of al-Ikhshid , on 1 January 969 . In almost complete control of the regime , al-Hasan nevertheless despaired of his ability to restore order to Egypt . Instead , he chose to leave the country to its fate and focus his energy and resources on trying to hold the Ikhshidid domains in Palestine and Syria . On 24 February 969 he abandoned Fustat , taking with him many provincial governors and administrative officials , as well as some of the best Ikhshidid troops under Shamul . Fustat was left in a complete power vacuum : Ibn al-Furat , who had been set free before al-Hasan 's departure , formally resumed his duties , but lacked any support among the remaining notables , who , on the other hand , were unable to put forward any candidate to replace him .
Faced with this impasse , the Egyptian elites were left only `` with the choice of seeking outside intervention '' , in the words of historian Yaacov Lev . Given the international situation at the time , this could only mean the Fatimids . Fatimid agents had for years operated more or less openly in Fustat , and had created an extensive network of contacts among the common people and the elites alike . This `` intensive period of psychological and political preparation '' ( Thierry Bianquis ) was decisive in undermining the will to resist and preparing the way for military conquest . During the crisis of 968–969 , letters from civilian as well as military leaders in Fustat were sent to the Fatimid caliph al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah ( ) in Ifriqiya , where preparations for a new invasion of Egypt were already in full swing .
When the Fatimid army under Jawhar arrived in Egypt in June 969 , all Ibn al-Furat could do was to supervise the negotiations for surrender with Jawhar .
Under the Fatimids
Jawhar was anxious to ensure an orderly transition of power , keep the administration running , and avoid the impression of a foreign , forcible take-over of Egypt . As a result he kept the Ikhshidid officials in place . Among others , Ibn al-Furat was kept in his post . He was not entirely trusted , however : when the Qarmatians invaded Egypt in September 971 , Jawhar had him placed under constant surveillance , and to avoid a defection , gave him a residence in the new capital of Cairo , then under construction .
Ja'far continued in office for under Jawhar , but was dismissed by the Fatimid caliph al-Mu'izz ( ) in favour of his rival Ibn Killis . Following the death of Ibn Killis in 991 , he was again offered the post of vizier , but resigned after a few months . He died in 1001 .
His son Abu ' l-Abbas was appointed vizier by the Fatimid caliph al-Hakim ( ) in 1014/5 , but executed after a few days .

Robert Mimbs ( born August 6 , 1964 in Kansas City , Missouri ) was a star Canadian Football League running back who played six seasons for three teams . He was named CFL All-Star three times and he won the Jeff Russel Memorial Trophy in 1991 and the Eddie James Memorial Trophy and Jeff Nicklin Memorial Trophy in 1996 .
NFL career
From 1986 to 1989 , Mimbs had tryouts with the New York Jets , Dallas Cowboys and Phoenix Cardinals of the NFL . Mimbs ' stint with Phoenix included time as a replacement player during the strike in 1987 .
CFL career
The Winnipeg Blue Bombers signed Mimbs for the 1990 season after his release by Phoenix , and Mimbs had a fantastic rookie season . In 1990 , Mimbs led the league with 1,341 rushing yards and caught 71 passes for another 538 yards . He led the league with 1,879 yards from scrimmage . Mimbs followed that up in 1991 with an even better season , he once again led the league with 1,769 yards rushing and had 39 catches for 438 yards . He set a CFL records with 2,207 yards from scrimmage in 1991 . Mimbs was named to the All-Canadian team in both of those first two seasons , won the CFL rushing title in both seasons and was the runner-up for the Most Outstanding Player in 1991 . Despite that success , Mimbs was released just seven games into the 1992 season by the Bombers with just 392 yards on only 76 carries which was a far cry from the number of touches he got in his first two seasons .
The BC Lions picked up Mimbs as a free agent and he played 3 games for them in 1992 and just two games in 1993 before Mimbs was released for the second time . After sitting out the 1994 season , Mimbs tried to revive his career by signing with the Saskatchewan Roughriders in September 1995 . Playing in only six games as the season wound down , Mimbs showed signs of returning to his old form , running for 444 yards . In a full season in 1996 , Mimbs showed he was back to his old form as he led the CFL in rushing for the third time in his career with 1,403 yards , he also led the league with 1,738 yards from scrimmage . He won the Roughriders ' Most Outstanding Player award . Mimbs also earned his third All-Canadian honour and was the Western nominee and eventual runner-up for the Most Outstanding Player in the CFL . Time and perhaps injuries seemed to catch up to Mimbs in his final season in 1997 as he ran for 493 yards in ten games . Mimbs finished his career with 6162 yards rushing .

From 1968 to 2012 at least 839 teacher strikes have occurred in the US . 740 of these have been in Pennsylvania . Teacher strikes and walkouts have since increased in popularity outside of Pennsylvania due to the Red for Ed movement in 2018-19 .
History
The 1919 Boston Police Strike chilled union interest in the public sector in the 1920s . The major exception was the emergence of unions of public school teachers in the largest cities ; they formed the American Federation of Teachers ( AFT ) , affiliated with the AFL . In suburbs and small cities , the National Education Association ( NEA ) became active , but it insisted it was not a labor union but a professional organization .
Legality
The legality of teacher strikes vary from state to state . Collective bargaining by public sector employees and therefore teachers is explicitly illegal in Georgia , North Carolina , South Carolina , Texas , and Virginia . 12 states have explicitly stated that teacher strikes are legal . These states are Alaska , California , Colorado , Hawaii , Illinois , Louisiana , Minnesota , Montana , Ohio , Oregon , Pennsylvania , and Vermont . South Carolina , Utah , and Wyoming have no explicit statutes or case law on the subject .
In states that explicitly ban strikes , teachers have employed alternative tactics , such as `` walkouts '' and `` sick-outs '' where the majority of teachers call in sick on the same day .
2018-2019 Education Workers ' Strike Movement ( Red for Ed )
In February 2018 , the US saw an education protest and strike movement , which began in West Virginia . Statewide , Oklahoma , Colorado , and Arizona followed suit . Demands varied from state to state but included funding sources for education , pension issues , increased pay .
Strikes by State
Colorado
Despite being explicitly allowed , Colorado had no teacher 's strikes between 1994 and 2018 . Pueblo Education Association went on strike May 2 , 2018 asking for a 2 % raise and $ 30 per a month for health insurance . The Denver Classroom Teachers Association , the largest teachers union in the state , went on strike in February of 2019 over low pay , and issues around an unpredictable and unjust compensation model .
Illinois
A strike of Chicago Public School teachers that occurred in 2019 was significant enough to garner support from national politicians .
Illinois holds the record for the longest teachers ' strike to date . This was an eight month strike in 1987 in Homer , IL . After roughly one month , the school board hired strike breaking substitutes for much of the school year .
Ohio
Ohio holds the record for the second longest teachers ' strike , which lasted for 85 days in 1981 .
Pennsylvania
Pennsylvania explicitly allows teachers to strike . However , since 1992 state act 88 gives the Pennsylvania Department of Education the power to order teachers to return to work to ensure that students still receive 180 days of instruction . This has subsequently reduced the frequency of teacher strikes in Pennsylvania , although the state still leads the nation in strikes . Between 2000 and 2007 , Pennsylvania accounted for 60 % of teacher strikes nationwide . 2010 saw 3 strikes , while 2011 had one strike . Between 1968 and 2012 Pennsylvania has had 740 teacher strikes . A major cause of strikes in Pennsylvania is that contracts are frequently allowed to lapse for several years before the school board and teachers union can come to a new agreement .
West Virginia
The West Virginia statewide educator walkout in 2018 began the Red for Ed movement .

In 2008 , he joined Independiente Santa Fe . He scored eight goals in the 2008-II tournament and had a good performance , but in the 2009-I tournament , new manager Hernán Darío Gómez did n't give him much playing time , so he only scored four goals , also because of various injuries he suffered . In June 2009 , he was loaned out to Independiente Medellin , where he scored many important goals , such as the two goals he scored against Junior in the playoffs on December 9 , to help Medellin qualify for the finals . In the finals against Huila , he scored a goal in the second leg , which eventually helped the club win the 2009-II tournament .
In January 2010 , he joined Jaguares de Chiapas along with his Medellin teammate , Jackson Martínez . After playing only six games and scoring no goals , he returned to Independiente Medellin and stayed there until December 2011 .

In July 2013 , he joined Deportivo Cali . Cali made the final of the 2013-II tournament that year , but lost to Mosquera 's former club , Atletico Nacional .
International career
Mosquera debuted for Colombia on April 30 , 2008 in a friendly match against Venezuela as a substitute in the 80th minute . He scored his first international goal only a few minutes after coming into the game , scoring the fifth goal for Colombia which they won 5-2 .

The Afghanistan cricket team toured India in June 2018 to play a one-off Test match against the India cricket team . It was Afghanistan 's first Test since they were awarded Test status by the International Cricket Council ( ICC ) in June 2017 . India won the match in two days by an innings and 262 runs . Afghanistan were dismissed twice in the same day , only the fourth time this has happened in Tests . It was India 's biggest win by an innings in Tests , and they became the first Asian team to win a Test match inside two days .
After the match , India 's captain Ajinkya Rahane said that it is just the beginning for Afghanistan , and playing more Tests and first-class cricket would improve the side . Phil Simmons , Afghanistan 's coach , said that the team were `` by no means happy ' with their performance '' , but believes they will get there with further hard work .
Background
In late 2017 , it was announced that Zimbabwe would be Afghanistan 's first Test opponents , but the tour was confirmed as being limited overs matches only . In December 2017 , the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) and the Afghanistan Cricket Board ( ACB ) confirmed that the match would take place in 2018 , with the exact date and venue to be announced at a later date . In January 2018 , both the ACB and the BCCI confirmed the Test would be played in June at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru . It was the first time a Test match was played in June in India .
Squads
India 's captain Virat Kohli announced that he would miss this Test match as he elected to play for Surrey County Cricket Club . This was in preparation for India 's tour to England the following month . However , a neck injury ruled him out of playing for Surrey in England . Ajinkya Rahane was named as India 's captain for the Test match in Kohli 's absence .
Prior to the final squad selection , Afghanistan had a team of thirty players warming up for the match in Greater Noida . On 29 May 2018 , the ACB announced a sixteen-man squad for the Test match , with Asghar Stanikzai named as the captain . Afghan bowler Rashid Khan said that `` it will be a big day for cricket in Afghanistan '' and he could not wait to become a Test cricketer . He later added that the match will be `` a test of patience '' and that he might end up taking no wickets .
Ahead of the Test , Wriddhiman Saha was ruled out of India 's squad due to injury , and was replaced by Dinesh Karthik . Mohammed Shami was also ruled out of India 's squad after failing a fitness test , being replaced by Navdeep Saini .
Before the Test , both captains commented on the significance of the fixture . Asghar Stanikzai , Afghanistan 's captain , said that `` to be playing our first Test against India is a great honour and we hope to give a good account of ourselves '' . India 's captain , Ajinkya Rahane , said `` it 's a privilege to be playing in Afghanistan 's first Test match '' adding that it will be an historic moment for the Afghan team .

The 1923 Renda earthquake occurred on March 24 at 20:40 local time between the counties of Daofu and Luhuo in Sichuan , China . The estimated 7.3 earthquake was assigned a maximum modified Mercalli intensity scale rating of X ( Extreme ) . Severe damage occurred in Sichuan , killing an estimated 4,800 people .
Tectonic setting
Western Sichuan is situated at the edge of the Tibetan Plateau in a vast zone of complex continental deformation caused by the collision of the Indian Plate with the Eurasian Plate . As the thrusting of the Indian Plate beneath the Eurasian Plate along the Himalayas continues , the continental crust within the Eurasian Plate is actively uplifted and thickened , forming the Tibetan Plateau . As there are no active thrust structures within the plateau , compression is accommodated by strike-slip motion along large structures including the Altyn Tagh Fault , Kunlun Fault , Haiyuan Fault and Xianshuihe fault system . Left-lateral strike-slip motion squeezes the crustal blocks of the Tibetan Plateau outwards , forcing it to move eastwards . Meanwhile , the strike-slip motion also results in east–west extension of the plateau , causing normal faults to break within the thickened crust .
Earthquake
The Xianshuihe fault system is a 1,400-km-long active left-lateral strike-slip fault that accommodate the strike-slip motion in the Tibetan Plateau . The fault is one of the largest active intracontinental geological structure in the world . Beginning in 1893 , at least 350 km of the fault length has ruptured in large successive earthquakes with magnitudes 6.5 or larger . Going back to the year 1700 to present-day , the fault has ruptured its entire 1,400 km length during large earthquakes .
A 60-kilometer-long surface rupture formed after the earthquake between Daofu and Renda . The immediate region around the surface rupture was also the meizoseismal area where the maximum intensity was X . The northwest extent of the rupture overlaps the eventual southeastern rupture zone of the 1973 Luhuo earthquake . Meanwhile , the farthest southeast rupture overlaps the northwest rupture extent of the 1981 Dawu earthquake . A maximum coseismic slip of 3.3 meters was measured near the village of Dazhai , while the average slip across the rupture was 3.0 meters . Coulomb stress transfer may have increased strain on the segment north of the 1923 earthquake rupture , causing it to fail during the 1973 earthquake .
Damage
In Luhuo county , the city 's defensive walls toppled to the ground . Many homes , official buildings , and places of worship were totally destroyed . Avalanches and landslides occurred on the mountains . Fissures measuring up to 2 meters across appeared in the ground . The death toll is in excess of 3,000 people .
Two villages in Dawu county were razed to the ground ; none left standing . An estimated 500 people were killed in the county . Several residents died in Qianning while many homes and schools were lost . At Kangding , at least 1,300 people died during a severe rockfall . Many temples suffered partial collapses whils poorly-constructed homes were destroyed . Damage to homes was also reported in Garzê Town , Xinlong and Litang .

Dickleburgh is a village in South Norfolk situated six miles north of the Suffolk border . It lies on the Pye Road , a Roman road that ran between Colchester and Caistor St. Edmund although a bypass was built in the early 1990s . Dickleburgh has a 15th-century church , primary school , The Dickleburgh Crown pub and hotel , a village shop and Post Office , a children 's play area and a village green .
The villages name means 'Dicel's/Dicla 's fortification ' . The specific might also be a place-name : Dic-leah , 'wood/clearing of Diss ' or 'ditch wood/clearing ' .
Dickleburgh is part of the parish of Dickleburgh and Rushall in the county of Norfolk and District of South Norfolk .
Present
Groups in the village include FODS ( Friends of Dickleburgh School ) , The Village Society , The Luncheon club and Sports , Social Club & Bowls club that plays in 3 local leagues . The village is home to Bob Flowerdew .
History
The village name derives from an Irish monk by the name of Dicul who had a brief settlement ( `` burgh '' ) in the area in the late 6th century , nothing of which survives today .
Although unconfirmed , this may be the same Dicul monk quoted by the Venerable Bede ( 673-735 ) in his Ecclesiastical History of the English People . He tells the story of the conversion of the South Saxons and mentions the Irish monk , Dicul , who had a small monastery in 'Boshanhamm ' , which today is Bosham near Chichester , West Sussex .
Dickleburgh was the birthplace of English painter George Cattermole in 1800 .
Throughout the 20th century , Dickleburgh had two pubs , two butchers — including T Wilbys and Sons , which was in business over 100 years — and briefly a small zoo .
Dickleburgh was dominated by a mill with homes for the workers and their families from 1780 producing herbage seeds and grain .
This became one of the country 's first steam mills in 1834 .
In the 1920s and 30s the business included the provision of coal , coke , hay and straw , and although materials come from all over the world , the mill always ground locally-grown wheat , barley and oats .
After the Second World War the company carried on a programme of steady expansion despite needing to generate its own electricity until 1958 .
The Mill was extended over a site originally occupied by old farm buildings and the new buildings designed to provide and facilitate bulk delivery . Later a weighbridge was installed , and storage arranged at Burston Station for direct transfer to rail trucks .
The Mill finally closed in 1988 . After disposal of the plant , its machinery and storage buildings , the land remained unused until purchased by Wimpey Homes in 1997 for a housing development which was completed within two years and remains today . The history of the land is remembered in the naming of the key cul-de-sac 'Millers Drive ' .
Semere
Semere was another village , which , at the time of William the Conqueror was approximately the same size as Dickleburgh . By 1736 it was very much insubordinate , and now only exists in local street names .

The Banc d'Arguin National Park ( ) of Bay of Arguin lies in Western Africa on the west coast of Mauritania between Nouakchott and Nouadhibou . The World Heritage Site is a major site for migratory birds and breeding birds , including flamingos , pelicans and terns . Much of the breeding is on sand banks including the islands of Tidra , Niroumi , Nair , Kijji and Arguim . The surrounding waters are some of the richest fishing waters in western Africa and serve as nesting grounds for the entire western region .
The Banc d'Arguin National Park is a Nature reserve that was established in 1976 to protect both the natural resources and the valuable fisheries , which makes a significant contribution to the national economy , as well as scientifically and aesthetically valuable geological sites , in the interests of and for the recreation of the general public .
The park 's vast expanses of mudflats provide a home for over one million migrant shorebirds from northern Europe , Siberia and Greenland . The region 's mild climate and absence of human disturbance makes the park one of the most important sites in the world for these species . The nesting bird population is also noted for its great numbers and diversity . Between 25,000 and 40,000 pairs belonging to 15 species , making the largest colonies of water birds in West Africa .
Conservation
The extensive intertidal flats of Parc National du Banc d'Arguin shelters on the most pristine seagrass beds on earth . Human impact is still at its minimum compared to the other intertidal systems along the East Atlantic Flyway . Only small indigenous community is allowed to fish in the Park boundaries using relatively primitive techniques and tools . No motorized boats are permitted in the area . Over the last decade , however , the international shark/ray market made its way to PNBA . Local starts to target these species although it is not allowed . It is perhaps the most challenging issue facing the conservation of the park .
People
The local population comprises about 500 or so Imraguen tribesmen that live in seven villages within the park . They base their economy on subsistence fishing using traditional methods .
Fauna
The park is host to one of the world 's most diversified communities of nesting piscivorous birds in the world . At least 108 bird species have been recorded , representing both Palaearctic and Afrotropical realms . Wintering shorebirds number over three million and include greater flamingo ( Phoenicopterus roseus ) , ringed plover ( Charadrius hiaticula ) , grey plover ( Pluvialis squatarola ) , red knot ( Calidris canutus ) , common redshank ( Tringa totanus ) and bar-tailed godwit ( Limosa lapponica ) .
Along with the regions in north such as the Cintra Bay and Dakhla Peninsula , the area is one of the most important wintering grounds for Eurasian spoonbill ( Platalea leucorodia leucorodia ) . Breeding birds include white pelican ( Pelecanus onocrotalus ) , reed cormorant ( Phalacrocorax africanus ) , gull-billed tern ( Gelochelidon nilotica ) , Caspian tern ( Hydroprogne caspia ) , royal tern ( Sterna maxima ) and common tern ( Sterna hirundo ) , together with several species or subspecies with an African distribution , such as grey heron ( Ardea cinerea monicae ) and Eurasian spoonbill ( Platalea leucorodia balsaci ) and western reef heron ( Egretta gularis ) .
For marine mammals , endangered species can be seen here all-year round ; for example , Mediterranean monk seals , Atlantic humpback dolphins and bottlenose dolphins . Other species can be seen here are orca , the killer whales , pilot whales , Risso 's dolphins , dolphins ( common , rough-toothed ) . Fin whales and harbor porpoises are also known to visit the area . Possibly , highly coastal whale species such as North Atlantic right whales , now-extinct Atlantic gray whales were used to be seen here as well . Other baleen whales possibly occur here include ; humpbacks , seis , blues , Brydes 's , and minkes , as they have been seen in either coastal or offshore waters .
Banc d'Arguin is rich in fish and the rare false shark ray is only known from this region .
Flora
Battering surf and shifting sand banks characterize the entire length of the shoreline . The Ras Nouadhibou ( formerly Cap Blanc ) peninsula , which forms Dakhlet Nouadhibou ( formerly Lévrier Bay ) to the east , is fifty kilometers long and up to thirteen kilometers wide . The peninsula is administratively divided between Morocco ( see Glossary ) and Mauritania , with the Mauritanian port and railhead of Nouadhibou located on the eastern shore ( see fig . 11 ) . Dakhlet Nouadhibou , one of the largest natural harbors on the west coast of Africa , is forty-three kilometers long and thirty-two kilometers wide at its broadest point . Fifty kilometers southeast of Ras Nouadhibou is Arguin . In 1455 the first Portuguese installation south of Cape Bojador ( in the present-day South Morocco ) was established at Arguin . Farther south is the coastline 's only significant promontory , seven-meter-high Cape Timiris . From this cape to the marshy area around the mouth of the Senegal River , the coast is regular and marked only by an occasional high dune .
On coastal dunes vegetation is rare . At the foot of ridges , however , large tamarisk bushes , dwarf acacias , and swallowworts may be found . Some high grass , mixed with balsam , spurge , and spiny shrubs , grows in the central region . The north has little vegetation .
Climate
The Coastal Zone , or Sub-Canarian Zone , extends the length of the approximately 754-kilometer-long Atlantic coast . Prevailing oceanic trade winds from the Canary Islands modify the influence of the harmattan , producing a humid but temperate climate . Rainfall here is minimal ; in Nouadhibou it averages less than three centimeters annually and occurs between July and September . Temperatures are moderate , varying from mean maxima of 28 °C and 32 °C for Nouadhibou and Nouakchott , respectively , to mean minima of 16 °C and 19 °C .
Geology
The depositional profile of the northern Banc d'Arguin describes a flat-topped platform , on which extensive carbonate deposits developed largely in water depths < 10 meters below sea level . Vast areas of the Banc d'Arguin are covered by mixed carbonate–siliciclastic sediments dominated by barnacles and mollusk remains plus admixed eolian siliciclastics . These sediments accumulate into extensive shoals , occasionally causing water depths below 5 m several dozens kilometers offshore the present shoreline . The bank edge forms a sharp morphological step , suddenly deepening from 10–20m down to 30–50m , and separates the inner shelf environments ( < 5–10m ; carbonate bank ) from those of the outer shelf . Assemblages formed by benthic foraminifers and mollusks and monospecific bivalve shell accumulations with admixed eolian silt characterize the platform cover in the outer shelf .
In the central and southern outermost shelf , silt-sized quartzose materials form confined bodies referred to as the Arguin and Timiris Mud Wedges . These deposits started to form with transgressional inundation early in the Holocene and have grown continuously and rapidly over the past 9 kyrs . Locally , the mud wedge deposits are incised by gullies and canyons towards the shelf break lying at around 80–110m . The southernmost Golfe d'Arguin describes a homoclinal ramp profile with vast intertidal plains around Tidra Island .
History
Because of its rich fishery and strategic location , the territory has been highly coveted and disputed by the European colonial powers of Portugal , France , England , Brandenberg/Prussia and Holland .
The Wreck of Medusa – La Méduse was a French frigate that ran aground at high tide off Banc d'Arguin on 2 July 1816.A scene inspired by the account of survivors Alexandre Corréard and Jean-Baptiste-Henri Savigny was made the subject of a painting in 1819 by Théodore Géricault called `` The Raft of the Medusa '' , which is displayed in the Louvre Museum in Paris , France .
Despite the Almoravid domination of Spain in the eleventh and twelfth centuries , there seems to be little evidence of contact during that time between Mauritania and Europe . The inhospitable coastline of Mauritania continued to deter voyagers until the Portuguese began their African explorations in the fifteenth century . Lured by legends of vast wealth in interior kingdoms , the Portuguese established a trading fort at Arguin , southeast of Cap Blanc ( present-day Ras Nouadhibou ) , in 1455 . The king of Portugal also maintained a commercial agent at Ouadane in the Adrar in an attempt to divert gold traveling north by caravan . Having only slight success in their quest for gold , the Portuguese quickly adapted to dealing in slaves . In the mid-fifteenth century , as many as 1,000 slaves per year were exported from Arguin to Europe and to the Portuguese sugar plantations on the island of São Tomé in the Gulf of Guinea .
With the merger of the Portuguese and Spanish crowns in 1580 , the Spaniards became the dominant influence along the coast . In 1638 , however , they were replaced by the Dutch , who were the first to begin exploiting the gum arabic trade . Produced by the acacia trees of Trarza and Brakna and used in textile pattern printing , this gum arabic was considered superior to that previously obtained in Arabia . By 1678 the French had driven out the Dutch and established a permanent settlement at Saint Louis at the mouth of the Senegal River , where the French Company of the Senegal River ( Compagnie Française du Sénégal ) had been trading for more than fifty years .
The Moors , with whom the Europeans were trading , considered the constant rivalries between European powers a sign of weakness , and they quickly learned the benefits of playing one power against the other . For example , they agreed simultaneously to give monopolies to the French and the Dutch . The Maures also took advantage of the Europeans whenever possible , so that when the French negotiated with the amir of Trarza to secure a monopoly on the gum Arabic trade , the amir in exchange demanded a considerable number of gifts . Thus began the custom , an annual payment expected by the Maures for doing business with a government or a company . By 1763 the British had expelled France from the West African coast , and France recovered control only when the Congress of Vienna in 1815 recognized French sovereignty over the coast of West Africa from Cap Blanc south to Senegal .

Pure Comedy is the third studio album by American folk musician Josh Tillman under his pseudonym Father John Misty . Its release was announced on January 23 , 2017 . It was released on April 7 , 2017 on Bella Union in the UK and Europe and on Sub Pop in the rest of the world . This is Tillman 's third studio album since his departure from Fleet Foxes . It was produced by Josh Tillman in collaboration with Jonathan Wilson , sound engineer Trevor Spencer and composer/double-bassist Gavin Bryars .
Production
Songwriting
Most of Pure Comedy was written in 2015 . It touches on themes of progress , technology , fame , the environment , politics , aging , social media , human nature , human connection and his own role in it all . Tillman included an 1800-word-long essay about its symbolism and meaning in the release announcement email to his fan club . Pure Comedy is the story of a species born with a half-formed brain . The species ' only hope for survival , finding itself on a cruel , unpredictable rock surrounded by other species who seem far more adept at this whole thing ( and to whom they are delicious ) , is the reliance on other , slightly older , half-formed brains . This reliance takes on a few different names as their story unfolds , like “ love , ” “ culture , ” “ family , ” etc . Over time , and as their brains prove to be remarkably good at inventing meaning where there is none , the species becomes the purveyor of increasingly bizarre and sophisticated ironies . These ironies are designed to help cope with the species ' loathsome vulnerability and to try and reconcile how disproportionate their imagination is to the monotony of their existence .
Recording
Pure Comedy was recorded in March 2016 at United Recording Studios in Los Angeles . Its basic tracking and vocals were recorded live , in no more than two takes each . It was mixed by Tillman , Wilson and sound engineer Trevor Spencer , and mastered by Bob Ludwig at Gateway Mastering Studios . Featured instruments include strings and horns . Bryars , along with additional contributors Nico Muhly and Thomas Bartlett , provided choral arrangements .
Promotion
Short film
In light of the album announcement , Tillman released his 25-minute short film Pure Comedy : The Film , captured by a six-person room throughout the recording of the album . He co-directed with Grant James . It is a monochromatic depiction of the live tracking and Tillman 's writing process .
Singles
The single `` Pure Comedy '' was released on January 23 , 2017 with a music video animated by Matthew Daniel Siskin featuring snippets of popular Internet videos .
The album 's second single , `` Two Wildly Different Perspectives '' , was released with a music video also animated by Siskin , and also containing popular videoclips , on January 30 , 2017 .
The third single released was `` Ballad of the Dying Man '' on February 1 , 2017 .
The fourth single , `` Total Entertainment Forever '' , was released on the night it was performed on Saturday Night Live ( along with `` Pure Comedy '' ) on March 4 , 2017 .
Other music videos
On April 26 , 2017 , a music video produced by Adam Green was released for `` Total Entertainment Forever '' . It features a crucified Macaulay Culkin as Kurt Cobain seen in a virtual reality world pictured in papier-mâché .
Jacknife Films , a production company best known for their work on Radiohead 's `` Burn the Witch '' and Run the Jewels 's `` Do n't Get Captured '' music videos , took on the project of a music video for `` Things It Would Have Been Helpful To Know Before the Revolution '' that was released on August 3 , 2017 .
Pure Comedy world tour
The Pure Comedy world tour , initially meant to be in the form of a musical , began in April 2017 and continued until early 2018 .
Critical reception
Pure Comedy received acclaim from critics . On Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications , the album received an average score of 85 , based on 36 reviews , which signifies `` universal acclaim '' . A review from The Record Store Clerk remarked that `` Pure Comedy ( shows ) a mature artist proving that he can continue to make music at the top of his game and likely will for years to come . '' In a highly positive review for Chorus.fm , Aaron Mook writes , `` Pure Comedy is a gorgeous album , an album that will remain important in the context of Tillman 's career , but above all things , it 's a genuine album . Sometimes , it 's hard to empathize with someone who refuses to tell you what you want to hear – especially if what they 're saying is true . '' Writing for No Depression , John Amen also offered high praise , calling Pure Comedy Tillman 's `` most ambitious , cohesive , and provocative release to date . ''
However , the album did divide some critics . No Ripcord gave the album a 4/10 , saying `` One of the most frustrating releases of recent times . Tracks meander insipidly , crushed by the weight of a solipsistic 'message ' and the real moments of quality only serve as a reminder of what might have been . '' Spin stated , `` He 's not really in a fun mood , and the music follows . The lushness has diminished , and the work evokes increasing comparisons to ‘ 70s singer-songwriters like Randy Newman and Harry Nilsson , who hid their acidic commentary within sturdy pop structures . ''
Pure Comedy received nominations for Best Alternative Music Album and Best Recording Package for its deluxe edition at the 60th Grammy Awards , winning the latter in a tie with Magín Díaz ' El Orisha de la Rosa .

Overlay architecture , or Overlay , is `` event architecture '' , such as the temporary elements that are added to more permanent buildings to enable the operation of major sporting events or festivals . These elements provide additional facilities for the duration of an event and are generally of a lightweight construction , as they are often removed afterwards .
Use
The role of overlay is extensive and can cover all aspects of a major event , starting with the `` back of house '' user groups , including staff , operations , officials , broadcast , media , hospitality , VIPs and the athletes themselves . These groups all require physical facilities to provide accreditation , accommodation , segregation and wayfinding , which need to be separated from , but connected to , the spectators at the `` front of house '' , to preserve the magic and mystery of the event experience .
It is important that the overlay design is integrated into the masterplan of major events at an early stage , in order that the flow of people through the site can be effectively managed and sufficient space provided for the various overlay facilities .
The overlay design also has a significant role in helping to define the overall environment of a major event . By taking a design-inclusive approach and considering the cultural and design aspects alongside the commercial and functional requirements , memorable places and spaces can be created out of simple components and hired commodities .
Overlay categories
Overlay can be categorised in three main ways :
Existing facilities : the overlay consists of temporary elements being added to an existing space to accommodate the specific needs of an event ( e.g . the Excel Centre , or the Archery range at Lord 's Cricket Ground )
New facilities : the overlay consists of temporary elements that are integrated with permanent elements in a new facility or venue for an event ( e.g . the Olympic Stadium )
Temporary facilities : the overlay creates a completely temporary facility or venue for an event ( e.g . the Beach Volleyball court at Horse Guards Parade , or the Equestrian Centre at Greenwich Park )

Ill Manors ( stylised as ill Manors ) is a British crime drama film written , co-scored and directed by Ben Drew AKA musician Plan B . The film revolves around the lives of eight main characters , played by Riz Ahmed , Ed Skrein , Keef Coggins , Lee Allen , Nick Sagar , Ryan De La Cruz , Anouska Mond and Natalie Press , and features six original songs by Plan B , which act as a narration for the film . Ill Manors is a multi-character story , set over the course of seven days , a scenario where everyone is fighting for respect . The film focuses on the violence that surrounds the main characters as they struggle to survive on the streets . Each story is also represented by a different rap song performed by Plan B .
Production
Prior to writing the script for Ill Manors , when Plan B was 21 years old , he had originally tried to begin production on another script he had written called Trigger , which was based on an incident where his home was raided by armed police . However , he was refused funding as he was an inexperienced director . To gain the necessary experience , Plan B wrote and directed his own short film Michelle in 2008 which was financed by himself with £4000 from the remaining recording advance from his record label and an inheritance from his grandfather .
The short film , which starred Anouska Mond , Ed Skrein and Adam Deacon , was released online and acted as a pilot for the feature film Ill Manors , which Plan B had completed the script for within four months of making Michelle . He also directed the music video for `` Pieces '' , his collaboration with Chase & Status , and also had roles in Adulthood ( 2008 ) and Harry Brown ( 2009 ) . The script for Ill Manors was partly based on actual events and stories Plan B had heard when he was young , such as a woman prostituting herself in order to repay a drug dealer . The film had been in development for three years prior to filming ; however , Drew struggled to secure finance for his film . Ill Manors was greenlit for production in 2009 as part of the Film London Microwave scheme .
For the film , Plan B hired a mixture of experienced and inexperienced actors , while several cast members already knew the director personally before they were cast in their roles . Riz Ahmed , who had previously recorded `` Shifty '' with Plan B , asked to play the lead role of Aaron after reading the script . Ed Skrein was a childhood friend of Plan B who had appeared in Michelle and had previously collaborated with him on numerous recordings .
Keef Coggins is Plan B 's godfather and Anouska Mond , who had also previously appeared in Plan B 's short film was invited to audition for her previous role as Michelle . The main casting process for the film took place during August 2010 with several cast members being young unknown actors from the East End of London , such as Ryan De La Cruz who was discovered when the crew visited Rokeby School in Canning Town , London .
Principal photography began on 1 September 2010 at 3 Mills Studios , London and filming lasted for four weeks on location in London , England . Plan B has named the 1996 film Pusher directed by Nicolas Winding Refn as a major influence on Ill Manors , as well as directors Shane Meadows and Quentin Tarantino . During production of the film , it was reported that the cast and crew ran into trouble with youths in Forest Gate , London and production was interrupted while a laptop containing the film 's dailies had to be recovered after being stolen by a drug addict . Drew claimed that he faced prejudice from some crew members while on set ; however , he also noted that `` there was some people that really believed in my vision and gave me all the support I needed . ''
Editing of the film began in December 2010 , but post-production of the film was delayed due to Plan B performing on The Defamation of Strickland Banks Tour during 2010 and 2011 . To raise funds for the completion of the film 's post-production , the distribution rights to Ill Manors were sold to Revolver Entertainment in April 2011 and Plan B delayed the release date of his planned third studio album The Ballad of Belmarsh until after Ill Manors was released .
Release
The trailer for Ill Manors was first aired on The Guardian 's website on 3 May 2012 , while the first film poster was first unveiled by Empire magazine 's website on 8 May 2012 . Digital Spy also unveiled two further promotional posters on 18 May and 7 June 2012 . The premiere took place on 30 May 2012 at the Empire cinema in Leicester Square , London . This screening was also attended by several British recording artists such as Alesha Dixon , Alexandra Burke , Professor Green , Tinie Tempah , Wretch 32 , Example and Ed Sheeran .
The film was given a wide release to 191 cinemas in both Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom by Revolver Entertainment on 6 June 2012 . Ill Manors was released in the Netherlands on 30 August 2012 by Benelux Film Distributors and was also screened at the Toronto International Film Festival and the Festival do Rio in September 2012 . Ill Manors was released on DVD on 8 October 2012 , and contains footage that was not broadcast at cinemas .
Reception
On its opening weekend , the film placed at number nine at the UK Box Office , with a gross figure of £256,288 . Domestically , the film has earned a total gross of £453,570 , after eight weeks at the box office . Ill Manors has received largely positive reviews from critics and fans alike , with a current 80 % `` fresh '' rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on thirty different reviews .

Description
The whiskered wren is long ; a specimen from Venezuela weighed . The nominate adult has a grayish-black crown , olivaceous gray nape , bright chestnut shoulders , back , and rump , and a reddish brown tail with dull black bars . It has a grayish white supercilium , a black line through the eye , blackish cheeks with a white line below and a black malar stripe below that . The chin and throat are off-white , the chest gray darkening to olivaceous gray on the belly , and the flanks reddish gray . The juvenile is duller than the adult with less prominent facial markings and a buffy throat .
The other subspecies have small differences from the nominate . P. m. saltuensis has a grayer chest and less distinct bars on the tail . P. m. yanachae has a slate-gray crown . P. m. macrurus tail is dingy brown . P. m. amaurogaster is much darker with a sooty brown crown and ochraceous tawny underparts . P. m. consobrinus has a buffy tinge to the supercilium and a buffy neck and chest . P. m. tachirensis is darker than consobrinus with a dusky olive crown and white throat . P. m. ruficaudatus has more buff on its face and no bars on the tail .
Distribution and habitat
The subspecies of the whiskered wren are found thus :
P. m. consobrinus , the Serranía del Perijá and Andes of western Venezuela from southern Lara south to Mérida
P. m. ruficaudatus , northern Venezuela from central Falcón and Yaracuy east to Miranda

History
Capoey was originally settled by Wapishana who named the village . The name translates to `` Land of the Rising Moon '' . The tribe was wiped out by a plague . A group of Lokono Amerindians who were enslaved on a plantation on the Essequibo coast escaped from captivity , crossed the lake , and resettled the abandoned village . In the early 20th century , a mission was founded by the Methodist Church .
Overview
The economy of Capoey is based logging , subsistence farming , gold mining , and tourism has become important . The village has a primary school , village office , and a health care clinic .

Beaumaris Gaol ( ; ) is a disused gaol located in Beaumaris , Anglesey , Wales . Although no longer in use it remains largely unaltered and is now a museum open to visitors , with around 30,000 visiting each year .
History
The jail was designed by Hansom and Welch , and was built in 1829 . It was expanded in 1867 to accommodate approximately 30 inmates but was closed just 11 years later . The building then became a police station until the 1950s when it became a children 's clinic and lastly a museum in 1974 . During the Second World War the town 's air raid siren was located in the gaol and was kept in operation during the Cold War in case of nuclear attacks . The gaol 's chapel is not original to the building , and the pews and pulpit were sourced from a chapel being renovated elsewhere on the island ; the numbering of the pews is out of sequence and they are not fixed to the floor .
The prison regime may appear brutal to a modern visitor , but in its day it was seen as humane improvement on earlier gaols . Even so , methods of keeping criminals in check included chains , whippings and isolation in a dark cell for up to three days . It has one of the last working penal treadmills in Britain . The treadmill at Beaumaris is unusual in that it pumped water to the top of the building for use in the cells , meaning that the prisoners were not forced to work for no reason .
Executions
Two hangings took place at Beaumaris . The first was that of William Griffith , in 1830 , for the attempted murder of his first wife . On the morning of his execution he barricaded himself inside the cell . The door was eventually forced open and he was half dragged and half carried to the gallows . The second execution was that of Richard Rowlands in 1862 , for murdering his father-in-law . He protested his innocence right up to the final moment and legend has it that he cursed the church clock from the gallows , saying that if he were innocent the four faces of the nearby church clock would never show the same time . Both men were buried within the walls of the gaol in a lime pit , but the exact location of their burial is unknown . The metal rivets which held the gallows in place , along with the two doors which the condemned man passed through , can still be seen from the street outside the gaol walls .
Escape
The only prisoner to escape from the gaol was John Morris , who escaped on 7 January 1859 , using rope he had stolen whilst working with it . He broke his leg while escaping , but made it out of the town , before being recaptured .

Blanca Luz Brum ( 31 May 1906 , Pan de Azúcar , Maldonado - 7 August 1985 , Santiago , Chile ) was a writer , journalist , poet and artist from Uruguay .
Biography
Brum was born on 31 May 1906 in Pan de Azúcar . Her family included her uncle , Balthazar Brum , a former president of Uruguay .
Family and relationships
Much of Brum 's reputation as a writer and artist was over-shadowed by her relationships . She was married several times : her first husband was the Peruvian poet , : es : Juan Parra del Riego . Riego kidnapped her from a convent and they married when she was 17 ; he died of tuberculosis three years later , leaving her with a young son .
She married the Mexican painter , David Alfaro Siqueiros , who she met in May 1929 . The couple lived in Los Angeles for a time . They married in 1932 , but separated in 1933 , whilst living in Montevideo . Whilst Siqueiros was imprisoned in 1930 , she kept him supplied with artists materials . During this period , Brum wrote him many letters which were later published as Penitenciaría-Niño Perdido . Pablo Neruda claimed to have been her lover during this time .
In 1935 , divorced from Siqueiros , she lived in northern Chile and married to Jorge Béeche , a mining engineer and radical . At the end of 1938 their daughter María Eugenia was born .
Brum had two sons : the first with Riego , the second with her fourth husband Nils Brunson . They both died in car accidents , separately .
Literature and art
Brum wrote rupturist poetry in the 1920s , contributed fiery articles to : es : Amauta ( revista ) and edited her own journal : Guerrilla : Atalaya de la Revolucion . She was also a painter , inspired by her poetry and politics . In the 1930s she was a role model for women in revolutionary art and politics . Some of her work , such as the poem Himno , is now viewed as very early ecofeminism .
Politics
During the earlier part of her life , Brum was a supporter of left-wing militancy . During her time in Peru , she became a Marxist , influenced by José Carlos Mariátegui . In 1927 she was deported from Lima back to Uruguay , for her involvement in a communist plot involving other intellectuals , such as Magda Portal .
From 1943 on , she was related to the union sectors that gave rise to Peronism in Argentina , she served as press officer for the Ministry of Labour and Social Security under Juan Domingo Perón . She played a leading role as an organiser and agitator in the workers ' mobilisation of 17 October 1945 , which freed Perón from his arrest ordered by a military coup d'état and opened the way to his electoral victory the following year .
She was exiled during the Uruguayan dictatorship ( 1973–1985 ) . She actively participated in politics in her country and in other Latin American countries where she lived , such as Chile or Mexico .
Life on Juan Fernandez Island
Brum became extremely interested with life on the remote Juan Fernandez Island and was eventually secluded there , due to her role in helping the escape from prison of the Argentine politician Guillermo Patricio Kelly . She wrote poetry about life there.In 1981 she became a Chilean citizen and died there four years later .

Vasilisa the Beautiful ( ) is a 1977 Soviet hand-drawn animated film directed by Vladimir Pekar and made by Soyuzmultfilm Studio . The story is based on the Russian folk tale The Frog Princess .
Plot
The tsar wants his three sons to get married . The brothers gather into an open field and shoot arrows into different directions . The arrow of the eldest son falls at the Boyarsky Dvor , to the daughter of a Boyar , arrow of the middle son - fell into the yard of a merchant , and the arrow of the youngest son Ivan falls into the swamp . Ivan is reluctant at first about taking a frog as his bride , but she manages to convince him . The tsar then assigns 3 tasks to each of the brides to see who is most worthy of royalty .
For the first task , he asks that all three of the brides each make him a shirt , `` fit for a king '' . That night , Ivan despairs over the fact that his bride is a frog , but the frog princess , Vasilisa , tells him to get some rest . As Ivan sleeps , Vasilisa transforms into her human form . She then creates the finest shirt for the tsar . When the shirts are presented to the tsar , he abhors the other shirts , but declares Vasilisa 's the most beautiful . He then assigns the second task : baking a cake fit for his holiday feast .
That night , the two other brides attempt to spy on Vasilisa , but leave soon after they realize she is still a frog . Vasilisa then returns to her human form to finish baking her cake . The next day , the tsar once again declares Vasilisa 's cake the best of the three . He then asks that each of his sons bring their brides to the castle the next evening , for a fine feast . Ivan is once again upset over having to present his frog bride , but Vasilisa urges him to go ahead to the feast , and that she will appear later .
As everyone arrives at the feast , the tsar notices that Ivan is arriving alone . He asks his son where his bride is . At that moment , Vasilisa appears in a coach in her human form . Everyone is astonished to see how beautiful and elegant Ivan 's bride is . During the feast , Vasilisa continues to impress everyone with her dancing and magic . The other brides attempt to mimic her , which erupts in chaos as they anger the tsar with their foolishness .
While everyone is distracted , Ivan sneaks back into his room to try and find the frog . Of course , he finds nothing—other than an old frogskin on the floor . Ivan carelessly tosses the frogskin into the fireplace . Vasilisa then appears . She reprimands him sadly , explaining that had he waited for just three more days they could have been together . As she transforms back into a frog , she tells him that if he truly loves her , he will search for her beyond the hills . She then disappears .
Ivan sets out to find Vasilisa . On his journey , he comes across a bear , a hare , a pike and a drake , and helps each of them in some manner . He then comes across the Baba Yaga . She tells him that Vasilisa has been cursed by a powerful wizard . In order to get Vasilisa back , Ivan must defeat the wizard by destroying his kingdom . With the help of the animals whom Ivan had aided earlier , he defeats the wizard . In the end , Vasilisa and Ivan are wed , and they live happily ever after .

Their latest album titled `` Turn On Your Radio '' was released on January 15 , 2008 . Their song `` Radio '' , from the album , serves as the theme song for Information Morning Moncton 's CBC Radio show since the fall of 2016 .
History
In 2002 , guitarist Neal MacLean and vocalist Corey Hachey ( who had previously met years ago ) unknowingly moved to the same city and found themselves looking to become part of the music scene . They eventually met up by chance and started the group right away , seeking out two more members . After many auditions , bassist Glen Farquhar and drummer Thom Cooke completed the foursome in May 2003 and Sproll started writing music and performing in local clubs .
Over the next year , the band wrote a collection of songs and enlisted the help of producer Laurence Currie at Idea of East in Halifax , Nova Scotia . During the winter months of 2005 and 2006 , pre-production of the EP `` Soft Science '' took place and was subsequently recorded during the spring-summer of 2006 at Idea of East studios . The album was released Canada wide with distribution by Outside Music and online by Maple Music and iTunes .
After touring throughout Canada and the North Eastern US from the summer of 2006 til the spring of 2007 , the band once again enlisted the help of producer Laurence Currie to work with them on their latest full-length recording , `` Turn on your radio '' . Recorded in Toronto , Ontario at Signal to Noise Studios and Sunnyside Studios from spring 2007 til fall 2007 , the new album consists of 11 tracks and will be available in early 2008 .
Present
With the new album completed , the band is focusing on planning their release in early 2008 . While information for the new album is scarce , guitarist Neal MacLean has said that `` ... we are very proud of the new album . It definitely shows our maturation of songwriting to date and we had a great time recording it . ''

George Forrest ( 13 March 1873 – 5 January 1932 ) was a Scottish botanist , who became one of the first western explorers of China 's then remote southwestern province of Yunnan , generally regarded as the most biodiverse province in the country .
Early life
George Forrest was born in Falkirk , Scotland on 13 March 1873 . He went to Kilmarnock Academy . After leaving school , he was apprenticed with a local chemist until 1891 when , on the inheritance of a small legacy , he then decided to travel to Australia , where he searched for gold and also worked on a sheep station before returning to Scotland in 1902 . Forrest 's life then took a most unexpected turn ; caught in a shower while fishing the Gladhouse Loch in Tweedsdale , he sought shelter beneath an overhanging bank where he chanced upon an ancient stone coffin .
The discovery led to his introduction to Professor Bayley Balfour , Regius Keeper of the Royal Botanic Garden , Edinburgh , who offered him a job in the Herbarium . Whilst Forrest doubtless found the indoor work dull , it was to provide an excellent preparation for his explorations . A year later , Balfour recommended Forrest , now aged 30 , to Liverpool horticulturist and cotton broker Arthur Kilpin Bulley , who was sponsoring an expedition to southwestern China in search of exotic plants , particularly species of rhododendron , of which Yunnan has many .
Plant collecting
George Forrest made his first expedition to Yunnan in 1904 . In August , he arrived at the town of Talifu ( Dali City ) .
He started setting up a base of operations and began to learn the local language . He then later helped with the inoculation of thousands of locals against smallpox . By the summer of 1905 , he was ready to mount his first expedition to the northwest corner of Yunnan near the border with Tibet . He and his team of 17 local collectors stayed briefly at the French mission under Père Étienne-Jules Dubernard in the small town of Tzekou . Forrest and his team then collected numerous plants , herbarium specimens and seeds . In the sanctuary of the rhododendron forests , so rich in variety of flora and fauna , the group was unaware of the massacre that was to meet them on their return to the mission , and that only one would survive .
As one source puts it `` This first trip was both exciting and horrifying . '' Foreigners had been targeted for death by the local Tibetan Buddhist lamas , during the 1905 Tibetan Rebellion . Forrest had a narrow escape , but this did not discourage him from returning to Yunnan . The Lamas pursued him until a Naxi `` King '' named Lee rescued him . He witnessed atrocities committed by the Lamas during the rebellion . He eventually became perhaps the foremost collector of Yunnan flora , amassing hundreds of species of rhododendron , and other shrubs and perennials .
He was honoured with the Royal Horticultural Society 's Victoria Medal of Honour in 1921 , and the Veitch Memorial Medal in 1927 , and was elected a Fellow of the Linnean Society in 1924 .
Altogether , Forrest made seven trips to Yunnan , collecting samples and seeds for the Herbarium and for avid collectors willing to pay for new species to add to their collections . In total , he brought back perhaps 31,000 plant specimens . He discovered numerous species including Gentiana sino-ornata . The specific epithet forrestii now adorns more than thirty genera . Including ; Rhododendron forrestii , Pieris formosa var . forrestii , Primula forrestii , Iris forrestii and Hypericum forrestii .
Botanical specimens collected by Forrest are held at herbaria around the world , most notably at the herbarium at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh . Collections are also held at the Hong Kong Herbarium , National Herbarium of Victoria at the Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria , Harvard University Herbaria , the herbarium at the Royal Botanic Gardens , Kew , and the Swedish Museum of Natural History .
Personal life
Forrest married Clementina Traill in 1907 ; they had three sons .
Death
On 5 January 1932 , while hunting game in the hills near Tengchong , the town wherein Forrest traditionally set up his base , he suffered a massive heart attack and died instantly . He was buried at Tengchong , next to his friend George Litton , who had been Acting British Consul there until his death 26 years earlier .

Transport in Western Sahara is very limited by sea , road and air with camels being the primary means of transport in the desert area . Road transport by buses remain the major mode of transportation . The longest conveyor belt in the world is long , from the phosphate mines of Bu Craa to the coast south of Laayoune . The belt moves about 2,000 metric tons of rock containing phosphate every hour from the mines to El-Aaiun , where it is loaded and shipped .
Portions of Western Sahara were a Spanish Colony till 1975 as the last colonial province in Africa . A war erupted between those countries and the Sahrawi national liberation movement , the Polisario Front , which proclaimed the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic ( SADR ) with a government in exile in Tindouf , Algeria . Mauritania withdrew in 1979 , and Morocco eventually secured control of most of the territory , including all the major cities and natural resources . With UN efforts ceasefire was implemented from 1997 between Polisario and Moroccan forces .
The world 's longest cargo train , the Mauritania Railway cargo train , passes through Western Sahara for a small distance on the south eastern corner of Western Sahara to end at Nouadhibou . The transport through Western Sahara was seriously disrupted during the wars till 1997 between Polisaro and Moroccan forces , when ceasefire was established with UN effort .
Background
Portions of Western Sahara were a Spanish Colony till 1975 as the last colonial province in Africa . A war erupted between those countries and the Sahrawi national liberation movement , the Polisario Front , which proclaimed the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic ( SADR ) with a government in exile in Tindouf , Algeria . Mauritania withdrew in 1979 , and Morocco eventually secured control of most of the territory , including all the major cities and natural resources . Polisario was formed in 1973 to fight for the rights of Sahawari Arab African People . Polisario attacked Moroccan positions many times and have retaliated . Continued war was waged between Polisario and Morocco over prominence in the region backed by Algeria for Polisario and US , France and Saudi Arabia for Morocco . Polisario were successful in cutting the transport of Phosphorus across Western Sahara to the Atlantic Coast . The transport infrastructure of the region , including the border towns of Morocco was affected during the wars .
Surface transport
Western Sahara has no rail service , with the exception of a section of the Mauritania Railway ; which ( since the closure of the Choum Tunnel ) , cuts across the extreme south-eastern corner of the territory . The rail-route is considered the world 's longest cargo train covering a distance of . Passengers with tickets ride in cramped cars while many illegal passengers , sometimes with livestock , ride on top of freight cars .
There are only of roads , of which are metalled . A small network of highways provides limited ground travel connections . N1 highway is a major roadway traversing along the Atlantic coastline of the country . There are a few roads in the north and only two roads in the south that branch off of N1 . All other roads are local ones in the various cities and towns . Off road driving is considered dangerous since there are `` thousands of unexploded mines '' in the area . Highway road plans in the region started by Algeria have been used to increase its own influence in the region . There are only 4 companies licensed to use buses in Western Sahara which are : CTM , Supratours , Satas and Sat ; CTM and Supratours buses have daily service from Dakhla to Marrakech via Laayoune and Agadir .
Rail transport
Since the closure of the Choum Tunnel , a section of Mauritania Railway cuts through the Polisario Front-controlled part of the Western Sahara ( ) .
Ports
The major port in Western Sahara is Ad Dakhla - small docking facility ( Port Marchand Lassarga/Port-Îlot ) located in a shelter bay south of the airport , Cabo Bojador - small port with fishing boats store inland and Laayoune ( El Aaiun ) - major deep water port facility ; used by vessels carrying phosphate , large fishing vessels and military patrol boats . The longest conveyor belt in the world is long , from the phosphate mines of Bu Craa to the coast south of Laayoune . The belt moves about 2,000 metric tons of rock containing phosphate every hour from the mines to El-Aaiun , where it is loaded and shipped .
Air transport
There are six airfields , three with paved runways and three unpaved surfaces , and one helipad ( military in Cape Bojador ) . Hassan I Airport , serving El Aaiún ( Laâyoune ) , is an international airport , but the carriers at the airport connect only to regional destinations ( to Morocco or the Canary Islands ) . Dakhla Airport is located in Dakhla and has commercial operational flights . Smara Airport in Smara and La Güera Airport serving La Güera are other smaller airports in Western Sahara .

Internet Haganah is a `` global intelligence network dedicated to confronting Internet activities by Islamists and their supporters , enablers and apologists . ''
Internet Haganah also is an activist organization which attempts to convince businesses not to provide web-based services to such groups , and collects intelligence to store and pass on to government organizations . It was formed by Aaron Weisburd , an American computer programmer from Illinois , in 2002 , and became part of a collection of private anti-terrorist web monitoring companies , including `` Terrorism Research Center '' , `` Search for International Terrorist Entities Institute '' , and `` Northeast Intelligence Network '' . Weisburd is the only full-time employee of Internet Haganah , which is run primarily from his home office , with the help of many online associates .
The organization
Haganah is a Hebrew word meaning 'defense ' . Haganah is also the name of the early Zionist militia originally formed to defend Jewish settlers in British Mandate Palestine , and which evolved into what is now the Israel Defense Forces .
There are two main parts to Internet Haganah :
A small , global band of researchers , consultants , analysts and translators , who `` associate and collaborate with each other as necessitated by our common desire to do more than just watch Islamists as they use the Internet . We [ Internet Haganah ] share an understanding that a jihad , or holy war , has been declared against the West , and these jihadists need to be met on whatever field of battle they may appear . ''
The parent organization is The Society for Internet Research .
Operation
The organization says it has taken down more than 1,000 Jihad sites . Their success logo is a blue drawing of an AK-47 .
To target websites perceived as threats , the organization relies upon its web community to find jihadists , and use a free `` whois '' service to determine if a US-based server hosts them . If so , as in the case of mawusat.com and its host Go Daddy , Internet Haganah operatives express concern about the nature of the site and ask the host to remove it . If this does not work and if the site concerns the US State Department 's list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations , or the US Treasury 's Office of Foreign Asset Control 's list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons , Internet Haganah contacts the banks and financiers of the host , who could face serious penalties for engaging in unreported transactions with the suspect website . If all else fails , the media may be contacted .
However , their targets often find countermeasures against these actions . In the case of GoDaddy.com and mawusat.com , the site was attacked , but appeared on a different server within a week . Newsweek reported :
It 's no coincidence , they argue , that in just the past year , Islamists have gotten savvier in their use of the Internet . In early 2004 , Iraqi insurgent Abu Mussab al-Zarqawi and his group posted the video of the execution of Nicholas Berg , an American contractor working in Iraq , to one Web site , which was quickly overwhelmed with traffic . Today , jihadis post evidence of their operations on dozens of sites and coordinate their operations on secret e-mail lists , password-protected Web sites and audio chat services like PalTalk , which do n't leave behind a printed record . “ The level of sophistication of these groups has become just unbelievable , ” says Rita Katz , who monitors Islamic Internet activities as director of the D.C.-based Site Institute . – Stone , Brad ( July 13 , 2005 . )
Founder
A. Aaron Weisburd is a `` half-Irish , half-Jewish New Yorker '' in Carbondale , Illinois . He was a philosophy major at George Washington University . He is the founder and Director of Internet Haganah , and also of the Society for Internet Research .
Press coverage
Internet Haganah has received press coverage from such publications as Wired News and Newsweek . A profile of Internet Haganah and their conflict with Islamist hacker Irhabi 007 was featured in the July/August 2006 of The Atlantic . Haganah has also been reported on by a Hamas newspaper .
Internet Haganah was identified by Media Matters for America as one of the sources to use the term `` Obama Intifada '' , a term critical of U.S. President Barack Obama 's policies on Israel .

Geragnostus is a genus of very small agnostid trilobites whose fossils are found Ordovician-aged marine strata from Eurasia , North America and Argentina .
Etymology
balanolobus is derived from the Greek 'balanos ' , acorn , and 'lobos ' , lobe , in reference to the outline of the rear lobe of the rhachis .
sidenbladhi has been named in honor of the Swedish philosopher and paleontologist Elis Sidenbladh .
waldorfstatleri is named after the muppets Statler and Waldorf for the likeness of the rhachis to their heads .
Taxonomy
Geragnostus is very similar to Trinodus and may in future be included in that genus . In Trinodus the posterior lobe ( M3 ) of the pygidial axis ( or rhachis ) is clearly shorter than the anterior and middle lobes ( M1+M2 ) combined , while in Geragnostus it is equal or greater in length . Geragnostus is not closely related to Micragnostus , because its glabella is structurally different .
Species previously assigned to Geragnostus
G. chronius = Oncagnostus ( Strictagnostus ) chronius
G. hirundo = Segmentagnostus hirundo
G. scoltonensis = Segmentagnostus scoltonensis
Distribution
G. clusus , was found in the Middle Ordovician of Canada ( Llanvirn , Lower Head , Newfoundland )
G. crassus , has been identified from the Lower Ordovician of Baltica ( Tremadoc ) , and the Lower ( Tremadoc of Yingou , Yumen County , Gansu ) and Middle Ordovician of China ( lower Llanvirn , Angzhanggou , Yumen County , Gansu )
G. fabius , Canada ( Newfoundland and Labrador )

Unidentified species in the genus Geragnostus have among others been found in Colombia ( Guaviare River , Meta ) .
Description
Like all Agnostida , Geragnostus is diminutive , with the headshield ( or cephalon ) and tailshield ( or pygidium ) of approximately the same size ( or isopygous ) and outline . Like all Agnostina , Geragnostus has only two thorax segments , where known . The cephalon is subquadrate in outline , and almost as long as wide . The highest point is the node in the centre of the centrally raised section of the cephalon ( or glabella ) . The glabella is about times the length of the cephalon , and its sides are very gently tapered forward , with a broadly rounded front , and is well defined by shallow furrows and an abrupt change in exoskeletal slope . It is 2 times as long as wide . The elongated glabellar node is prominent . The rear of the glabella is straight . Just in front of the node , a depression curves forward- and outward . The basal lobes are wider than they are long and almost touch . The border is relatively narrow , gently convex , and defined by a wide , shallow border furrow , widest at the front . The genal angles are pointed without spines .
The pygidial axis ( or rhachis ) is – times as long as the pygidium , almost parallel-sided , very slightly constricted at the middle lobe ( M2 ) , broadly rounded , and – times as long as wide . It has three distinct pairs of lobes , and is defined by shallow furrows . The forward lobe of the rhachis ( M1 ) is a bit shorter and wider than the middle lobe ( M2 ) and separated from it by a furrow ( F1 ) which is directed outward and slightly backward from the dorsal furrow , and then curved strongly forward adaxially . The rear lobe ( M3 ) is – longer than both others together , and the furrow is directed outward and slightly forward from the dorsal furrow . The middle lobe has a prominent tubercle , which extends backwards above the anterior portion of rear lobe . It is the highest point of the pygidium . The border is moderately wide , gently convex , defined by a shallow furrow , and widest at the rear corners which carry a pair of strong , backwardly directed spines .

The white-tailed cotinga ( Xipholena lamellipennis ) is a species of bird in the family Cotingidae . It is endemic to Brazil in the northern portions of the Amazon Basin 's southeast quadrant .
Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests .
Xipholena range overview
Of the three Xipholena genera , X. atropurpurea , the white-winged cotinga is located on southeastern coastal Brazil in a 125 km wide restricted range strip stretching about 3500 kilometers .
Pompadour cotinga , X. punicea and white-tailed cotinga , X. lamellipennis complete a total range of the Amazon Basin , with the white-tailed cotinga completing the entire range of the southeast Amazon quadrant , the northern portion . This range does not cross the Amazon River into the northeast quadrant with the Guianas . The range only abuts the southwest quadrant of the pompadour cotinga , with no overlapping .
The white-tailed cotinga 's southeast Amazon Basin range encompasses the lower drainage , ( about one third ) , of the Tocantins-Araguaia River system , and ends in the east at the Atlantic Ocean in the state of Maranhão . To the west , it encompasses the lower reaches of the tributary , the Tapajós River .

Henry Ludwig Mond , 2nd Baron Melchett ( 10 May 1898 – 22 January 1949 ) was a British politician , industrialist and financier .
Early life and education
Henry Mond was born in London , the only son of Alfred Mond , 1st Baron Melchett and his wife Violet ( née Goetze ) . He was educated at Winchester College . In the First World War he was commissioned with the South Wales Borderers on 9 April 1915 and wounded in 1916 .
Business life
He then joined some of his father 's businesses , becoming a director of Imperial Chemical Industries and serving as deputy chairman from 1940 to 1947 . He was also a director of the Mond Nickel Company and Barclays Bank .
Politics
He served as Member of Parliament for the Isle of Ely 1923-24 as a Liberal . He won against Unionist candidate Max Townley in the 1923 general election with a small majority of 467 . In the same election his father , Sir Alfred Mond , Bt , lost his seat of Swansea West . He was unable to retain the Isle of Ely at the 1924 general election .
Like his father , he later became a Conservative . He was Conservative Member of Parliament for Liverpool East Toxteth from 1929 to 1930 , when , on the death of his father , he succeeded to the barony becoming the 2nd Baron Melchett . He then set about restoring the family finances and moved his interests away from politics to economics .
Religion
Having been brought up in the Church of England , he reverted in the 1930s to his family 's original Judaism and became a champion of Zionism , hoping that the Jews and Arabs could live harmoniously alongside each other . He advocated the evacuation of Jews from Germany to Palestine and supported the formation of an independent state of Palestine as part of the British Commonwealth . He was chairman of the Jewish Agency for Palestine and took an interest in the Maccabi Jewish youth organisation .
Personal life
He married Amy Gwen Wilson ( usually called Gwen , the daughter of Edward John Wilson , who lived in Johannesburg ) , at Chelsea Register Office on 30 January 1920 . She was described as `` a show stopping beauty and artist '' . Their relationship began when she was living with writer Gilbert Cannan , a friend of D. H. Lawrence , and they initially formed a ménage à trois .
From 1930 the couple lived in a London home , Mulberry House in Smith Square , Westminster . Paying homage to their early relationship , they commissioned a high relief from the prominent artist Charles Sargeant Jagger called `` Scandal '' , which they displayed in their living room . This showed a naked couple in an intimate embrace watched by society ladies in a state of outrage . The sculpture and the Baron 's relationship led to censure and outrage from their contemporaries . In 2008 `` Scandal '' was bought for £106,000 by the Victoria and Albert Museum where it is on display .
Family
They had had two sons – the Honourable Derek John Henry Mond ( 18 October 1922 – 30 April 1945 ) , Julian ( 9 January 1925 – 15 June 1973 ) , and one daughter , the Honourable Karis Valerie Violet ( 26 July 1927 – 8 February 2006 ) . Derek was killed in a flying accident while he was serving with the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve in 1945 .
Mond bought and restored Colworth House on the edge of the Bedfordshire village of Sharnbrook and lived there for twelve years . During World War II he made the house available for the recuperation of American nurses and to house Jewish refugees . He sold the house to Unilever in 1947 due to his wife 's belief that moving to Florida would restore his health . He died at Miami Beach , Florida in 1949 aged 50 and the title passed to his surviving son Julian . Mond was cremated in Islington .

Uh-Huh is a 1983 album by John Cougar Mellencamp , a stage name for John Mellencamp and a transition from his early work under the name John Cougar . It was Mellencamp 's seventh studio album and the first in which he used his real last name . It charted at # 9 on the Billboard 200 .
Uh-Huh contained three Top 20 Billboard Hot 100 hits : `` Crumblin ' Down '' ( # 9 ) , `` Pink Houses '' ( # 8 ) , and `` Authority Song '' ( # 15 ) . In 1989 , it was ranked No . 32 on Rolling Stone magazine 's list of the 100 Greatest Albums of the 80 's .
The remastered version was released March 29 , 2005 on Mercury/Island/UMe and includes one bonus track .
Songwriting collaborations
Mellencamp almost always writes all of his own material . However , Uh-Huh saw him engage in one-time collaborations with two distinctly different songwriters : the legendary John Prine on `` Jackie O '' , and the unknown Will Cary on `` Lovin ' Mother Fo Ya '' .
Of `` Jackie O '' , Mellencamp said on the Bob and Tom Show in November 2004 : `` I ca n't take credit – John Prine wrote most of that song . ''
Mellencamp had written `` Lovin ' Mother Fo Ya '' and was playing it live on his 1982 American Fool tour before it was even recorded ( and before Cary had anything to do with the song ) . According to a 2003 article on LouisvilleMusic.com , Cary sent Mellencamp 's guitarist Mike Wanchic a copy of Out of My Dreams , an album he had recorded with his band the Nightcrawlers . Out of My Dreams contained a song called `` Cruisin ' in the Park '' , which Mellencamp liked . This led to a phone call regarding Mellencamp 's wanting to record `` Cruisin ' in the Park '' as the first single from Uh-Huh . Cary recalled , `` He ended up using the fourth verse from my song to start his song , 'Lovin Mother Fo Ya ' . '' A writing-credit deal was signed and Cary got 15 % royalties for that song .
In addition , Mellencamp turned a song his hairdresser , Dan Ross ( also lead singer in a local Indiana band ) , had started into `` Play Guitar '' . Mellencamp 's guitar player , Larry Crane , added to the music of `` Play Guitar '' , which has numerous musical similarities to Van Morrison 's `` Gloria '' .
Songs
Cash Box reviewed the single release of `` Authority Song '' saying `` Opening with a twanging country riff , this rocker jumps off the vinyl with the authority that Cougar-Mellencamp is singing against : ' I fight authority , and authority always wins ! ' '' Cash Box especially praised the `` pounding rhythm section and percussion work . ''
Cash Box also said that `` with a resounding bass line and lyrics that bite , 'Serious Business ' is the kind of all-out rocking that Mellencamp makes his own as he renders some of the finest rock artistry around . ''

Elmer H. Ripley ( July 21 , 1891 – April 29 , 1982 ) was an American basketball coach . He coached college basketball at seven different schools and for several professional teams .
Early life
Ripley was born in Staten Island , New York on July 21 , 1891 . After graduating from local Curtis High School , he attended Brown University .
Playing career
Considered to be one of the great basketball coaches of the 20th century , Ripley began his career as a player before making the switch to coach in 1922 . At age 19 , Ripley decided to leave Brown to play basketball professionally with the Interstate League Brooklyn Trolly Dodgers , the New York League 's Utica Utes and the `` Original Celtics '' club . Ripley would enjoy numerous achievements including being voted among the ten best pro players from 1909 to 1926 .
Coaching career
After playing , he went on to coach basketball at several major American universities and traveled the world teaching the game . Ripley began his first professional coaching tenure with Wagner College in 1922 , before moving into a position at Georgetown University in 1927 . His skills as a coach were evident as he won 12 of his first 13 games . During his many years with the Georgetown , he achieved a 133–82 record and lead the Hoyas to the NCAA tournament in 1943 , reaching the national championship game . Ripley was in high demand and was hired away by several prestigious colleges including Columbia University , University of Notre Dame , and Yale University , which he coached to the 1933 Ivy League championship .
After leaving Georgetown for good in 1949 , Ripley coached the Harlem Globetrotters ( 1953–1956 ) , the Israeli Olympic team ( 1956 ) and the Canadian Olympic team ( 1960 ) . Held in high regard , the U.S. Committee for Sports sent Ripley to Israel in 1957 to teach basketball . Ripley continued to coach through his 80th birthday and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1973 .

Acebutolol , sold under the brand names Sectral among others , is a beta blocker for the treatment of hypertension and arrhythmias . Acebutolol is a cardioselective beta-1 blocker and has intrinsic sympathetic activity . It is commonly used in the treatment of angina .
It was patented in 1967 and approved for medical use in 1973 .
Medical uses
Hypertension
Ventricular and atrial cardiac arrhythmia
Acute myocardial infarction in high-risk patients
Smith–Magenis syndrome
Contraindications
Stable or unstable angina ( due to its partial agonist or ISA activity )
Side effects
The development of anti-nuclear antibodies ( ANA ) has been found in 10 to 30 % of patients under treatment with acebutolol . A systemic disease with arthralgic pain and myalgias has been observed in 1 % . A lupus erythematosus-like syndrome with skin rash and multiforme organ involvement is even less frequent . The incidence of both ANA and symptomatic disease under acebutolol is higher than under propranolol . Female patients are more likely to develop these symptoms than male patients . Some few cases of hepatotoxicity with increased liver enzymes ( ALT , AST ) have been seen . Altogether , 5 to 6 % of all patients treated have to discontinue acebutolol due to intolerable side effects . When possible , the treatment should be discontinued gradually in order to avoid a withdrawal syndrome with increased frequency of angina and even precipitation of myocardial infarction .
Pharmacology
Acebutolol is a cardioselective beta-1 blocker which also considered a partial agonist due to its intrinsic sympathomimetic activity ( ISA ) . This means it provides low-grade beta stimulation at rest but acting as typical beta-blockers when sympathetic activity is high . Among other drugs in the beta-blocker class , Acebutolol will provide beta-blockade effects to a lesser extent . Due to its cardioselectivity , Acebutolol is more suitable than non-cardioselective beta-blockers , in a patient with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) who needs treatment with a beta-blocker . This cardio-specificity will minimize the anti-hypertensive effects as seen with non-specific beta blockers such as Propanalol and Nadolol . ( For these reasons , it may be a beta-blocker of choice in inclusion in Polypill strategies ) . In doses lower than 800 mg daily its constricting effects on the bronchial system and smooth muscle vessels are only 10 % to 30 % of those observed under propranolol treatment , but there is experimental evidence that the cardioselective properties diminish at doses of 800 mg/day or more .
The drug has lipophilic properties and therefore crosses the blood–brain barrier . Acebutolol has no negative impact on serum lipids ( cholesterol and triglycerides ) . No HDL decrease has been observed . In this regard , it is unlike many other beta-blockers which have this unfavourable property .
The drug works in hypertensive patients with high , normal , or low renin plasma concentrations , although acebutolol may be more efficient in patients with high or normal renin plasma concentrations . In clinically relevant concentrations , a membrane-stabilizing effect does not appear to play an important role .
Pharmacokinetics
Acebutolol is well absorbed from the GI tract , but undergoes substantial first-pass-metabolization , leading to a bioavailability of only 35 % to 50 % . Peak plasma levels of acebutolol are reached within 2 to 2.5 hours after oral dosing . Peak levels of the main active metabolite , diacetolol , are reached after 4 hours . Acebutolol has a half-life of 3 to 4 hours , and diacetolol a half-life of 8 to 13 hours .
Acebutolol undergoes extensive hepatic metabolization resulting in the desbutyl amine acetolol which is readily converted into diacetolol . Diacetolol is as active as acebutolol ( equipotency ) and appears to have the same pharmacologic profile . Geriatric patients tend to have higher peak plasma levels of both acebutolol and diacetolol and a slightly prolonged excretion . Excretion is substantially prolonged in patients with renal impairment , and so a dose reduction may be needed . Liver cirrhosis does not seem to alter the pharmacokinetic profile of the parent drug and metabolite .

They thought I was very arrogant . Moreover , football was completely different from what I was used to in the Netherlands . You will then find out that you are actually between two cultures . You are a foreigner everywhere . ''

The Cold Spring Cemetery Gatehouse is located along Peekshill Road in Nelsonville , New York , United States . It is a cut granite Gothic Revival cottage built in 1863 , one of the earliest uses of that style in the Hudson Highlands . It is used as a house today and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 .
It is a one-story building of coursed granite with a jerkin roof cross-gabled on both north and south ( front and back ) . The roof is pierced by a brick chimney ; the arched projecting front entrance is flanked by lancet windows . The east facade , facing the cemetery , has a porch whose roof is supported by four pillars with decorative brackets . There is a projecting bay window on the west side . Both gables are topped by two dormer windows . Opposite the house is a small stone booth with lancet windows , connected to the cemetery 's stone wall .
The Cold Spring Rural Cemetery Association bought a parcel in Nelsonville shortly after its formation in 1862 . New York City architects Mead and Woodward were hired to design the grounds while Woodward 's frequent collaborator George E. Harney worked on the gatehouse . It was finished by 1865 in time for its photograph to be used in the association 's bylaws pamphlet .

The white grouper ( Epinephelus aeneus ) is a species of marine ray-finned fish , a grouper from the subfamily Epinephelinae which is part of the family Serranidae , which also includes the anthias and sea basses . The white grouper is found in the subtropical eastern Atlantic Ocean and the southern Mediterranean Sea .
Description
The white grouper has a head which is longer than its body is deep , the standard length being 3 to 3.6 times the depth of the body . The dorsal profile is convex between the eyes . The preopercle is angular and has with 3 to 6 large spines at its angle , the lowest being directed downwards . The dorsal fin contains 10-11 spines and 14-16 soft rays while the anal fin has 3 spines and 7-9 soft rays . The caudal fin is rounded and the body is covered in small scales which are set within thick skin . There are over 90 scales in the lateral line . The overall colour is greenish bronze with darker fins which are brownish purple and have white or pale margins . There are 3 or 4 pale blue or white lines across the gill cover , these can be quite faint in larger adults . The juveniles have faint dark spots on their body which create 5 indistinct dark vertical bars . The juveniles also have indistinct dark spots on the fins . The maximum total length this species has been recorded at is , although they are more common at around , and the maximum published weight is .
Distribution
The white grouper is found in the eastern Atlantic Ocean from southern Portugal and southern Spain south along the western coast of Africa as far south as Angola , including the islands in the Gulf of Guinea . Its occurrence in the Canary Islands and Madeira needs to be verified . It is found in the southern and eastern Mediterranean but appears to be expanding its range northwards being formerly absent north of 44°N in the Adriatic Sea and to be absent from the central Mediterranean but there have been records from Corsica and Monaco , among other recent northerly Mediterranean Sea records . There is a history of vagrancy in this species and the synonym Perca robusta was based on a specimen taken in Cornwall in southwestern England .
Habitat and biology
The white grouper occurs on substrates of rock or mud and sand while the juveniles are found in coastal lagoons and estuaries , and adults are found at depths between . This is a carnivorous species and off West Africa it was found that 58 % of their diet is made up of fishes , 21 % of stomatopods , 10 % of crabs and 10 % of cephalopods . There is a seasonal migration of this species off the coasts of Senegal and Mauritania , which is linked to an upwelling off the coasts of those nations . They are protogynous hermaphrodites with the females reaching sexual maturity on attainment of a total length of and at an age of 5–7 years and the sex change to males occurs when they are 10 to 13 years old . Off Tunisia this species spawns during June and July while in Iskenderun Bay in Turkey , spawning starts in early June and continues up to late August .
Taxonomy
The white grouper was first formally described in 1817 as Serranus aeneus by the French naturalist Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire ( 1772-1844 ) with the type locality given as Egypt .
Utilisation
The white grouper is a very important quarry species for fisheries throughout its range , fishermen use hook-and-line and trawls to catch it . In Senegalese waters , artisanal fishers are the main landers of this species , however , there is a local commercial fishery which is set up for the export market , mainly to Europe . Overfishing is the major threat to the white grouper . Even where protected it has been targeted by poachers using spear guns and lights at night . It has been bred in aquaculture at the Israeli National Center for Mariculture . It is marketed fresh or preserved by smoking .

White Mill is a smock mill west of Sandwich , Kent , England that was built in 1760 . The mill has been restored and is open to the public as part of the White Mill Rural Heritage Centre . The museum also includes the miller 's cottage , which has been furnished to appear as it did between 1900 and 1939 . Other displays in the outbuildings include farming and craft tools , wheelwright and blacksmith workshops .
History
White Mill was built in 1760 . It was marked on Andrews , Drury and Herbert 's map of 1769 and the 1819–43 Ordnance Survey map . The mill was worked by the Stanley family for many years . The mill was last powered by wind in 1926 . From then until 1957 it was being powered by a oil engine .
The mill was repaired in the 1960s by Vincent Pargeter before he became a professional millwright . A pair of sails from the demolished Tower mill at Wingham was erected on the mill . The work was initially financed by Pargeter himself but in 1964 , the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings gave a grant for the purchase of materials to repair the mill . The mill was acquired by Sandwich Borough Council in 1968 , and later passed into the ownership of Kent County Council .
Description
White Mill is a three-storey smock mill on a single-storey brick base . It has four spring sails . The mill is winded by a fantail . The mill drives two pairs of millstones by wind , and a third pair is driven by an engine . Much of the machinery is made of wood , including the brake wheel , wallower , great spur wheel , and stone nuts . The millstones are overdrift .

Kufra ( ) is a basin and oasis group in the Kufra District of southeastern Cyrenaica in Libya . At the end of nineteenth century Kufra became the centre and holy place of the Senussi order . It also played a minor role in the Western Desert Campaign of World War II .
It is located in a particularly isolated area , not only because it is in the middle of the Sahara Desert but also because it is surrounded on three sides by depressions which make it dominate the passage in east-west land traffic across the desert . For the colonial Italians , it was also important as a station on the north-south air route to Italian East Africa . These factors , along with Kufra 's dominance of the southeastern Cyrenaica region of Libya , highlight the strategic importance of the oasis and why it was a point of conflict during World War II .
Etymology
The folk etymology associaters the word Kufra as coming from the Arabic word kafir , the Arabic term for non-Muslims ( often translated as `` infidels '' , literally `` those who conceal [ the truth ] '' ) , with reference to the Toubou people native to the region .
Geography
Kufra is an elliptic shaped basin , oriented northeast-southwest . The major axis is , the minor long . It is bordered by hills which are at most 100 m high . The soil consists of red marl or sand and in the lowest parts there are salt lakes or dried salines .
In the basin lie the following oases :
Al Jawf ( `` Center '' ) , the largest , situated at the northeast end of the basin , long and wide . It is rich with palms and gardens .
Buma and Buema , both small and situated to the east of Al Jawf . Gerhard Rohlfs set his camp north of Buema , and since then the locality is known as `` Garet-en-Nasrani '' ( `` Field of the Christian '' in Arabic ) . Kufra Airport is located in Buma .
Ez-Zurgh , situated to the south of Al Jawf . It consists of a line of Palm trees . Until the Italian occupation it was inhabited only by slaves .
Et-Tleilíb and Et-Talláb , both situated to the southwest of Al Jawf . The latter is the farthest from Al Jawf , lying away .
On the north edge of the basin , there is the village of El Tag , which means crown in Arabic , which does not contain an oasis . It was founded by Sayyid Muhammad al-Mahdi as-Senussi , the son of the founder of the Senussi order , when he moved to Kufra and is considered the holy place of Senussi .
Climate
Kufra has a hot desert climate ( Köppen climate classification : BWh ) .
History
Early history
Claudius Ptolemy wrote that around 90 AD Julius Maternus ( or Matiernus ) carried out a mainly commercial expedition . From the Sirte gulf he reached the Oasis of Cufra and the Oasis of Archei , then arrived , after 4 months travelling with the king of the Garamantes , to the river Bahr Salamat and Bahr Aouk , near modern-day Central African Republic in a region then called Agisymba .
In 1154 al-Idrisi described a place identified by Lewicki as the oasis of Kufra . Al Idrisi writes that the place was once flourishing and peopled , but was by that point in ruin , its wells dry , its herds returned to the wild . In the late 15th century , Leo Africanus reported an oasis in the land of the Berdoa , visited by a caravan coming from Awjila . It is possible that this oasis was identical with either the Al Jawf or the Tazirbu oasis , and on early modern maps , the Al Kufra region was often labelled as Berdoa based on this report . Berdoa possibly corresponded to the Toubou , a Nilo-Saharan speaking tribal people indigenous to the region . Kufra did not fall under the dominion of either the Arabs or the Ottomans and was part of a Toubou Sultanate with capital in Tazirbu . In the 1840s , the Toubou were colonized by the Arabized Berber tribe of Zuwayya and eventually by the Italians in the 1930s .
Early Western contact and the Senussi
The territory of Kufra was first explored by Westerners beginning with the 1873/74 expedition by German Gerhard Rohlfs . Rohlfs reportedly first reached the oasis from the north in 1879 .
Kufra was an important trade and travelling route for various nomadic desert people . In 1895 the Ottomans forced the Senussi to leave Jaghbub , making the oasis their main centre . After that , Westerners could no longer visit it until the First World War , when several soldiers of the Entente were held prisoner there .
In 1931 , during the campaign of Cyrenaica , General Rodolfo Graziani easily conquered Kufra , considered a strategic region , leading about 3,000 soldiers from infantry and artillery , supported by about twenty bombers .
Many refugees fled the Italian conquest eastwards via Uweinat into Egypt . The British explorer Pat Clayton , engaged in mapping areas of previously unmapped desert , encountered the Kufra refugees when running triangulation from Wadi Halfa to Uweinat , and helped save many from death in the arid desert .
Italian takeover of Kufra
The Frankfurter Zeitung reporter and author Muhammad Asad interviewed a man from Kufra after its seizure by the Italians in his book The Road to Mecca . According to Asad 's source , the Italians attacked from three sides , with armored cars , artillery , and aircraft . The defenders , a few hundred men with only small arms unable to penetrate the Italian armor , defended the place house-to-house but were overwhelmed . The Italians ( and their Eritrean auxiliaries ) then raped the women , tore up a Koran and cast it on the ground , cut down the palm trees , burnt Sayyid Ahmad 's library , and took some of the elders and scholars and hurled them to their death from airplanes .
Italian rule and World War II
In the following years the Italians built an airfield ( now Kufra Airport ) in Buma oasis and a fort in El Tag , which dominated the area .
Buma airport was equipped with a radio-centre for flight assistance and was often used as a stop for routes toward Asmara and Italian East Africa . The fort was also used as a radio post to guide in Italian aircraft as well as to maintain communication with Italian East Africa .
Kufra increased its importance when the Second World War started and , after the Suez Canal was closed to Italian shipping , connections with Italian East Africa became mainly aerial , using Kufra and its strategic location .
Kufra , thanks to its key role for the Italian Royal Army , soon became a target for the Allies , with Free France and British desert troops beginning a long battle for its conquest . On 31 January 1941 Pat Clayton , an explorer recruited by British Intelligence , was captured by the Italian Auto-Saharan Company near Jebel Sherif , when leading `` T '' Patrol in reconnaissance of the planned attack on Kufra .
The Free French from Chad , with General Leclerc leading a combined force of Free French and Chad native troops , attacked and took Kufra in the Battle of Kufra .
In later stages of the Western Desert Campaign , Kufra was used as a staging post for Allied units such as the Long Range Desert Group and the Special Air Service .
In May 1942 it was a location of the Tragedy at Kufra , where three South African Air Force Bristol Blenheim aircraft became lost and after landing safely the crews subsequently died due to lack of water .
After the war
After the Axis were expelled from North Africa , and when after the war it became part of independent Libya , the Buma airfield at Kufra has fallen into disrepair and is little-used . The town surrounding the Oasis is still dominated by the old fort of El Tag , built by the Italians in the mid-1930s .
On 26 August 2008 , a hijacked Sudanese Boeing 737 landed at Kufra Airport after having departed from Nyala Airport , Darfur , with destination Khartoum . Earlier , Egyptian authorities had refused to allow the plane to land in their national capital , Cairo .
In recent decades , Kufra has become a major point on the route of African migrants who try to reach Europe by various routes , and some of whom get incarcerated in Kufra 's notorious prison .
During the 2011 Libyan Civil War , the area was reported to be under control of anti-Gaddafi forces and not the government of Muammar Gaddafi on 2 April 2011 . On 28 April 2011 , loyalist forces reportedly re-captured Kufra . There were no reports of casualties in the fighting for the town after the rebels put up only light resistance . By 6 May 2011 the town had been retaken by the Libyan rebels . In February 2012 , fighting between the Tobu and Zuwayya tribes killed over a hundred people and the town became a focal point for mass human rights violations of refugees and migrants .
Tourism
Kufra is situated in the middle of the Sahara for its pristine desert beauty , so that tours to the oasis are organized by local tour operators .
Kufra in migrants ' routes and human trafficking
Migrants coming from the East African coast and the Near East pass through and compulsorily stop in Kufra . It is a little village of transit along the traditional route between Khartoum and the coastal Libyan towns , which has lately turned to be a spot gathering Libyan-Sudanese criminal organizations involved in the illegal transport of immigrants , police officers controlling the boundaries and the need of people working in local productive activities .
The village of Kufra has long been suspected and accused by European Parliamentary delegations as being criminally instrumental in assisting migrants . In 2007 , they defined Kufra as `` a free zone , a sort of starting Centre of Temporary Permanence CPT against the law ... These gathering centres are places , in which the first contacts with the criminal organizations occur . Such organizations promote the `` journey of hope '' , with a flexible handling of the Migrants ' African routes according to the restriction policies adopted by the various governments . The minds of the criminal organizations act accordingly to what happens in each country : if Morocco stresses its restrain policies , the routes move towards the Canary Islands , if the controls in Libya increase , the streams are diverted towards Malta . When the migratory stream is over , the routes are back on Libya and Tunisia . ''
The route towards the coastal Libyan towns is done at night on covered trucks . Such journey conditions are described as `` hellish '' . People are often stopped by the police and therefore the route is covered many times in both directions . Once the migrants arrive , or are brought back , in Kufra , the only way to escape this situation is to pay people traders , which are often colluded with the police officers . People brought back to the Sudanese border may reverse the course just with cash money . Hence the occurrence of continuous exploitation , enlistment in the work and prostitution black market , painful waiting for a money order urged by relatives and friends through mobile phone communications , which are allowed only for this aim .
In 2005 Italy allocated funds for the creation of a detention camp at Kufra .
Inhuman conditions of detention
Kufra jail is defined by Ethiopian and Eritrean migrants , who stayed there , as :
Agricultural project
At the beginning of the 1970s , Libya launched a great cultivation project in Kufra aimed at developing agriculture in the desert . LEPA irrigation is provided by fossil water beneath the ground surface , the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System , a non-renewable source and the only accessible water resource in the area . Rotors ( high sprinkler that rotates ) provide irrigation and the obtained circles have a diameter of about 1 km and can be observed from space .
This is one of Libya 's largest agricultural projects . Because only about two percent of Libya 's land receives enough rainfall to be cultivated , this project uses the underground aquifer . The green circles in the desert frequently indicate tracts of agriculture supported by center-pivot irrigation . The agricultural project is an easy-to-recognize landmark for orbiting astronauts aboard the International Space Station . The Libyan government also has a project called the Great Manmade River to pump and transport these groundwater reserves to the coast to support Libya 's growing population and industrial development . As of December 2011 , the excessive exploitation of the aquifer has provoked the complete drying up of the lake in the oasis .

Hurricane Jeanne was a moderate hurricane that formed and dissipated in the Gulf of Mexico without making landfall , only one of four occurrences in the 20th century . The thirteenth tropical cyclone , tenth named storm , and eighth hurricane of the 1980 Atlantic hurricane season , Jeanne developed over the southern Caribbean on November 7 . It moved swiftly northward , and it intensified to a tropical storm on November 9 . It entered the southern Gulf of Mexico on November 10 . Jeanne turned to the west on November 11 , and it rapidly intensified to its peak intensity of 100 mph ( 155 km/h ) . It weakened on November 12 , and its forward motion slowed ; the cyclone weakened further to a tropical storm because of dry air intrusion , and it executed a clockwise loop on November 15 . It dissipated on November 16 .
At the time , Jeanne was one of three November hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico ; it was the first tropical cyclone to attain hurricane strength in the Gulf of Mexico during November . The late season storm surprised maritime interests , and two barges broke free from towing vessels . Indirectly , the hurricane produced heavy precipitation that peaked at 23.28 inches ( 591 mm ) in Key West . Minor beach erosion occurred along the Texas coast , where tides were two to four feet above normal ; coastal flooding affected the state , which was heavily impacted by tropical cyclones in August and September . Jeanne caused no deaths .
Meteorological history
On the late afternoon of November 7 , an area of disturbed weather organized to a tropical depression 60 miles ( 100 km ) east of Atlántico Norte , Nicaragua . Its origins were traced to a tropical wave that originated over western Africa on October 26 . Atmospheric conditions resembled an early fall pattern , and a large ridge was situated over the Gulf of Mexico and Southwestern United States . The depression moved northward into the Caribbean Sea , and the environment supported further development . On November 9 , the depression strengthened to a 40 mph ( 65 km/h ) tropical storm and was given the name Jeanne . Later , an Air Force reconnaissance aircraft reported a strengthening system ; maximum sustained winds increased to 50 mph ( 80 km/h ) , and a minimum pressure of 999 mbar was measured . The tropical cyclone moved northward into the southern Gulf of Mexico on November 10 . Jeanne 's northward movement was blocked by the ridge , and the cyclone slowly turned to the west . On November 11 , Jeanne quickly intensified to a minimal hurricane ; later , it attained its peak intensity of 100 mph ( 155 km/h ) .
On November 12 , Jeanne weakened to a Category 1 hurricane . It entered the western Gulf of Mexico , and its forward motion diminished as the ridge moved east . Later , Jeanne diminished to a 65 mph ( 105 km/h ) tropical storm . A developing trough remained west of Jeanne , and the cyclone was embedded in a weak pressure gradient . Although Jeanne briefly re-intensified to 70 mph ( 110 km/h ) , an advancing frontal boundary brought dry air over the western Gulf of Mexico . Jeanne weakened to a depression on November 14 . It executed a clockwise loop , and it merged with the frontal boundary on November 16 .
Preparations
Some residents on Dauphin Island voluntarily evacuated , spurred by memories of 1979 's Hurricane Frederic and Jeanne 's northward motion . 3,000 workers evacuated their oil rigs because of Jeanne 's high waves . The National Hurricane Center advised small watercraft to remain in ports from Brownsville to Tarpon Springs . Forecasters expected tides of 2 feet above normal in Louisiana , which increased to 4 feet above normal along coastal Texas . In Terrebonne and Lafourche parishes , schools were closed because of uncertainties regarding Jeanne 's path . The hurricane center also expected Jeanne to make landfall in southwestern Louisiana , although the hurricane eventually stayed offshore ; thousands of residents moved inland , while Civil Defense officials remained alert . Forecasters expected locally heavy rainfall , although they suggested it would remain below 8 inches ( 203 mm ) .
Impact
The combination of a large high pressure system and Jeanne produced rough seas over the northern Gulf of Mexico ; wave heights reached 15 feet ( 4.60 m ) . On November 11 , a ship reported sustained winds of 110 mph ( 175 km/h ) , although this reading was discarded and attributed to intense squalls . In Key West , the storm 's outer fringes produced a record-breaking 24-hour rainfall total of 23.28 inches ( 591 mm ) ; 13.58 inches ( 345 mm ) fell within six hours . It remains the record 24-hour November rainfall total for the city as of 2018 . The previous record was set in 1954 . The heavy precipitation was attributed to a mesoscale feature ; an inflow band intersected with an adjacent stationary front , which also contributed to the deluge . Schools and most businesses were closed , while flights were grounded at Key West International Airport ; authorities urged residents to stay home . Telephone and power services were cut to some areas of the city .
Elsewhere , several ships were caught off guard by the late arrival of Jeanne . The cyclone entered the Gulf of Mexico , and two barges broke loose from towing vessels via strong winds and high waves . One barge was an oil rig tender that contained 16 people ; it was carried several hundred miles across the central Gulf of Mexico . All crew members survived , and there were no maritime deaths related to the hurricane . Jeanne produced a prolonged period of rough surf and heavy swells along the Texas coast . Tides reached 2 to 4 feet ( 1.20 m ) above normal . The hurricane caused coastal flooding ; the worst flooding occurred near Galveston .
Jeanne was one of only four tropical cyclones in the 20th century to attain hurricane status in the Gulf of Mexico without making landfall ; the others were Laurie of 1969 , Henri of 1979 , and Alberto of 1982 .

A strike by about 27,000 machinists at Boeing over outsourcing , job security , pay , and benefits began September 7 , 2008 .
The union , International Association of Machinists , and Boeing appeared unwilling to compromise to settle the strike . The company had 3,700 jets on back order , which union members hoped would put pressure on Boeing to end the strike .
In late October 2008 , a tentative deal was reached between Boeing and the union , in which Boeing made a number of concessions .
Boeing told SPEEA engineers that the company planned less outsourcing on future airplanes , including the next 787 Dreamliner model .
On November 1 , 2008 , members of the union ratified the contract , ending the eight-week strike . The new contract was approved by 74 percent of those voting in favor . This was the longest strike against Boeing by this union since 1995 , and the fourth in twenty years . The strike cost the union members an average of $ 7,000 in base pay and cost the company $ 100 million per day in revenue and penalties with a postponement of the delivery of aircraft . Boeing has a $ 350 billion backlog .

The 3rd Grand Prix , 12 Hours of Sebring , was the inaugural round of the 1953 World Sportscar Championship and was held at the Sebring International Raceway , on 8 March 1953 .
Report
Entry
A total of 81 cars were entered for the event , across eight classes based on engine sizes , ranging from up to 750cc to over 8.0 litre . Of these 59 cars practised , 54 qualified to race .
Amongst the mostly American entrants , the greatest news for the 1953 race was that the famous English Aston Martin team would join the French factory DB 's for the 12 Hour competition . In fact , David Brown and René Bonnet , heads of these European manufacturers , both went to Florida to watch the race . Bonnet also took part in the race .
Race
The race started at noon , and ran until midnight , on a day described as `` partly cloudy and mild '' , in front of an estimated crowd of 12,500 spectators .
The Aston Martins made a great start , leading the first 32 laps of the Florida road course before losing the lead as a result of an accident . The # 57 Cunningham C-4R then took over lead and was never headed for the rest of the race .
The car was driven by Phil Walters and John Fitch took the winner spoils for Briggs Cunningham 's team . They were boosted to the lead when the front running Aston Martin of Geoff Duke and Peter Collins collided with a Jaguar , and was forced to retire with accident damage . Walters and Fitch drove their Florida license plated Cunningham C-4R to victory , covering a distance of 908.9 miles , averaging a speed of 75.338mph . One lap adrift in second place was the Aston Martin DB3 of the Reg Parnell and George Abecassis , despite reportedly being hampered by having one of its headlamps not working due to an earlier collision with a bollard filed with concrete marking the circuit on what was at the time largely an airfield .
There was one car fire , the Allard-Cadillac J2X of Paul Ramos was destroyed when a fuel line split , however the driver , Anthony Cumming escaped unharmed . Another competitor , Randy Pearsall , also escaped injury when he flipped his Jaguar XK120 .

Lands of Lore III is the third game in the Lands of Lore video game series , a sequel to Lands of Lore : Guardians of Destiny . The game was released after much delay in 1999 by Electronic Arts . The game set uses a first-person perspective .
Plot
The story takes place some time after Guardians of Destiny , and is based on the adventures of Copper LeGré , the son of Eric and fourth in the line of succession , whose uncle Richard rules the Lands . In the beginning of the game , Copper 's father and two half brothers are slain by a dreadful rift hound , and Copper 's own soul is torn from his body . As a result , Copper must not only retrieve his soul , but also settle the allegations now leveled against him as he was the only survivor . As the new sole heir to the Kingdom of Gladstone , many believe he orchestrated the whole incident with his father and brothers . Coupled with that is the fact that he is the result of an illicit affair between his father and a Dracoid barmaid—a half-breed heir . He must not only deal with those issues but also seek out answers to help close new rifts that have appeared throughout the Lands .
The story unfolds over many portal worlds in which Copper has to retrieve lost pieces of the Shining Path ( which shattered when the Draracle left the Gladstone world ) . The same Draracle has sent Copper on his quest to save his life and soul as well as to save his home and world .
Gameplay
Set in a first-person perspective , the game mechanics work as hack and slash when utilizing melee weapons . It uses many common elements of RPGs such as the guilds the player can join , having both weapons and magic attacks , and several portal worlds . There is an inventory screen , where the player can collect many weapons , armour and other items such as food . The leveling system works whereby using abilities enough will lead to levelling up in the guild that specialises in that particular ability , and higher levels unlock more skills .
Guilds
There are four guilds : a warriors ' guild , a magicians ' guild , a clerics ' guild , and the illegal thieves ' guild . Each one has its own set of quests to accomplish throughout the game , a familiar ( a creature who accompanies and assists the player throughout the game ) , and a guild building containing shops , guild masters and sometimes training areas . The avatar , Copper , must join at least one , but has the option to join the others also .
Reception
The game received mixed reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings .

Seward Smith ( born Granville , Massachusetts , August 1 , 1830 , died probably Iowa , December 10 , 1887 ) was an Iowa Republican politician , lawyer , and associate justice of the Dakota Territory Supreme Court .
He moved to Des Moines , Iowa in 1860 and in 1868 Seward was elected city solicitor of Des Moines as a Republican . By February 1879 Smith was still practicing law with his partner ( Ripley N. Baylies ) in Mitchellville , Iowa . On August 10 , 1881 the Republican Party of Des Moines nominated Smith as candidate for the State Senate .
In July 1884 President Chester A. Arthur appointed Smith to the Supreme Court of Dakota Territory on the recommendation of the Aberdeen , South Dakota circuit judge . However Smith quickly became controversial , appointing a woman ( Elizabeth M. Cochrane ) clerk of Faulk County district court , an unusual appointment for the time . Smith went on to announce his candidacy for the senate while still serving as a sitting territorial supreme court justice . Critics began openly questioning his sanity while even his proponents admitted to his poor health . In October 1885 President Grover Cleveland removed Smith from office and appointed Louis K. Church of New York to replace him . Smith 's friends admitted him to an Iowa sanitarium where he subsequently died . He is interred in Woodland Cemetery in Des Moines , Iowa .

The Baikal Rift Zone is a series of continental rifts centered beneath Lake Baikal in southeastern Russia . Current strain in the rifts tends to be extending with some shear movement . A series of basins form along the zone for more than , creating a rift valley . The rifts form between the Eurasian Plate to the west and the Amur Plate to the east .
Structures
To the northwest of the rifts is the Siberian Craton , on the Eurasian Plate . The Sayan-Baikal and Mongolia-Okhotsk mobile belts are formations to the southeast of the rifts ; beyond the Sayan-Baikal fold belt is the Amur Plate .
Basins form along the rift . There are three basins in the area , the South Basin , Central Basin , and North Basin . In the North , half-grabens form smaller basins , such as the North Baikal Basin , and the Chara-Tokka Basin . The Central Basin is the deepest in the rift system . The largest fault it contains is the Morskiy Fault ; however , another fault , the Primorsky is becoming the primary fault in the rift . The basins also display evidence of crustal thinning below the rift zone .
The thickness of the crust beneath the rift is disputed , as the structures of the rift deep beneath the surface are unknown . The difference in thickness of the crust , between the crust under the rift and that under the surrounding areas , has been bounded to be less than . Although some seismic data is evidence for a rise in the Lithosphere-Asthenosphere boundary , other researchers have claimed that there are deep structures which influence seismic activity , and that the lower crust is intruded by mafic sills . They interpret the extension as a pure shear process .
Volcanism
Volcanism is generally associated with the rift . Hot springs are present both on land and under Lake Baikal , although thus far , no evidence of actual volcanism has been found in the immediate vicinity of the lake . Despite this , Cenozoic volcanism has occurred nearby and is probably associated with the Baikal Rift Zone . Early volcanism has been confirmed to exist from the early Miocene , although it is believed that Oligocene Volcanism exists . The recognized volcanic centers are the Udokan Plateau , located about 400 km ENE of the northern tip of Lake Baikal , the Oka Plateau , located about 200 km WNW of the southwest tip of Lake Baikal , the Vitim Plateau , around 200 km east of the rift , and the Azas Plateau .
Geological history
The area was originally characterized by Precambrian and Paleozoic northeast-southwest fold and thrust belts . The Primorsky fault zone of the central basin was present at this time also . Volcanism began in the late Cretaceous in limited areas , but is mostly limited to the Miocene . The late Cretaceous is also the age of sedimentary rocks in some basins , and the same series lasted into the Eocene . Rifting resumed beginning in the Oligocene , and is commonly held to have increased since the middle Pliocene , causing the formation of basins in the form of grabens . The new rift structure may follow the Precambrian and Paleozoic faults , such as when the dormant Primorsky fault , of the Central Basin , began to extend again in the late Cenozoic . Magmatic activity and rifting may also be independent events . Outside of the grabens basalt volcanics erupted from either end of the rift system during the uplift . The grabens mostly spread without releasing magma , except the Tunkin Depression .
Most basin deposits are from the late Oligocene , except in the north where basin deposits began in the Pliocene . Three series of sediment are present ; the 'proto-rift ' , the 'middle rift ' , and the 'modern rift ' . The proto-rift unit is made of shallow-water deposits and is often folded and faulted . Overlying this unit , separated by a small unconformity , is the 'middle rift ' unit of Pliocene coarse grained sandstones and conglomerates . Finally there is the modern rift unit of fluvial , glacial , and deltaic sediments . Examining Pliocene and younger sediments reveals sands , argillites , and silts , indicating lacustrine deposition .
Seismic monitoring
The first seismic station in the region was opened in Irkutsk in 1901 , which began instrumental observations . New instruments were put in place in 1912 , and the system was expanded in the 1950s and 1960s . The monitoring network is still in operation , although the minimum spacing has been criticized for exceeding in the minimum distance between stations . Studies from foreign experiments also provide new information about the rift system .

Along the boundary both normal and shear strains have occurred in the rift . Plates are diverging along the boundary at per year , although this varies along the system . In addition to divergent movement , left lateral strike-slip movement also occurs in the fault system , such as along the Sayan Fault . The rate of slip has been estimated at per year in the north by looking at offsets of morphological features , although this estimate does not agree with current models . The total throw that has occurred has been estimated at in extension and in the vertical direction .
Due to the distance from active plate boundaries , the driving forces of the rift are unknown ; however , possibilities include the subduction of the Pacific Plate and the collision of the Indian subcontinent with Eurasia . Locally , there may be a mantle up-welling driving the extension . This latter theory is held by most Russian scientists .

The Sulu pygmy woodpecker ( Yungipicus ramsayi ) , also known as the Sulu woodpecker , is a species of bird in the family Picidae . Formerly lumped with the Philippine pygmy woodpecker ( Y. maculatus ) , it seems to form a superspecies with this and the Sulawesi pygmy woodpecker ( Y. temminckii ) . Some taxonomic authorities continue to place this species in the genus Dendrocopos or Picoides .
It is endemic to the Philippines . Its natural habitats are tropical moist lowland forest , tropical mangrove forest , and arable land . It is threatened by habitat loss .
Description
EBird describes the bird as `` A small woodpecker of lowland wooded areas on the Sulu Islands . Dark brown above with some white spots on the back , a white rump , throat , and underparts with faint streaking , and buffy sides of the chest . Note the alternating dark brown and white stripes on the head , with a dark forecrown . Hind crown is dark in females and bright red in males . Unmistakable . No other similarly sized woodpeckers occur in its range . Voice includes a series of rapid notes in a forceful trill . ''
Habitat and Conservation Status
It inhabits forest clearings , forest edge , mangroves and cultivated areas , in addition to primary forest , although it has been speculated that it avoids dense forest . It is seen in altitudes up to 550 meters above sea level . However , its habitat preferences are poorly understood . Its tolerance of degraded habitats implies that it should be more numerous than is the case .
The IUCN Red List classifies this bird as a vulnerable with population estimates of 2,500 to 9,999 mature individuals . Although this species is supposedly more tolerant of habitat degradation , it is still threatened by habitat loss with wholesale clearance of forest habitats as a result of legal and illegal logging , mining , conversion into farmlands or palm oil plantations and urbanization . Due to the rapid loss of habitat in the Sulu Archipelago , many of the birds endemic to the region like the Sulu hornbill , Tawitawi brown dove , Blue-winged racket-tail , Sulu hawk-owl are all threatened with extinction .
There are no species specific conservation programs going on at the moment but conservation actions proposed include more species surveys to better understand habitat and population . Lobby for protection of remaining forest . Continue to expand environmental awareness programs and raise the species profile and instill pride in locals

At the end of World War II , the Russians occupied this area and drove out the residents . The inhabitants of nearby Ramnitz could not escape the Russian advance . They hid in the Rambower forest and returned on the following day to the village . The East Prussia refugees had fled the Russians , but more people came after that . The Russians occupied Ramnitz in the evening hours of 8 March 1945 .
Poland could , because of the Russian crew , only 1950 into the possession of the village set itself . The inhabitants were driven out at a relatively late time from their homeland . The residence card index Pommern determined 192 refugees from this village in the Federal Republic of Germany and 78 in the GDR . The German municipality , Ramnitz , became the Polish Karznica .

Froland Church ( ) is a parish church of the Church of Norway in Froland Municipality in Agder county , Norway . It is located in the village of Froland . It is one of the two churches for the Froland parish which is part of the Arendal prosti ( deanery ) in the Diocese of Agder og Telemark . The white , wooden church was built in a long church design in 1718 using plans drawn up by an unknown architect . The church seats about 295 people .
History
The earliest existing historical records of the parish date back to the year 1399 and the earliest existing records of the church are from 1425 as the `` Frodelands Sogn i Nidardal '' , however the church was likely founded during the late 13th or early 14th century ( before the Black Death in Norway ) . By the beginning of the 1700s , the old church was quite dilapidated , so in 1704 there was a royal resolution that stipulated that the old church be torn down and replaced . However , Bishop Jens Bircherod would not allow the church to be torn down before the financing for the new was in order . He asked every farm to deliver timber for the new church . During the demolition of the old church 1715 , old idols were found which were thrown into the nearby river . The new church was completed in 1718 on the site of the old church . The new church was consecrated on 1 November 1718 . In 1727 , a large tower and steeple was built above a new entry porch . In 1887 , the church was enlarged to the east . The old choir was torn down , the nave was lengthened by , and then a new choir built at the east end of the building . A sacristy was built on the north and south sides of the new choir as well . After World War II , a complete restoration of the church was carried out .

Trichoepithelioma is a neoplasm of the adnexa of the skin . Its appearance is similar to basal cell carcinoma .
One form has been mapped to chromosome 9p21 .
Types
Trichoepitheliomas may be divided into the following types :
Multiple familial trichoepithelioma
Solitary trichoepithelioma
Desmoplastic trichoepithelioma
Pathology
Trichoepitheliomas consists of nests of basaloid cells , with palisading . They lack the myxoid stroma and artefactual clefting seen in basal cell carcinoma . Mitoses are uncommon when compared to basal cell carcinoma .
Diagnosis
Trichoepiteliomas often contain Merkel cells ; an immunostain for CK20 can be used to demonstrate this .

An email disclaimer is a disclaimer , notice or warning which is added to an outgoing email and forms a distinct section which is separate from the main message . The reasons for adding such a disclaimer include confidentiality , copyright , contract formation , defamation , discrimination , harassment , privilege and viruses .
Issues frequently dealt with in email disclaimers
Confidentiality
A disclaimer may be added to mitigate the risk that a confidential email may be forwarded to a third-party recipient . Organizations may use the disclaimer to warn such recipients that they are not authorised recipients and to ask that they delete the email . The legal force and standing of such warnings is not well-established .
Contract
A disclaimer may state that the email does not form a contract . This may not be effective as the substantive body of the email may contradict and override this . In the case of Baillie Estates Limited against Du Pont ( UK ) Limited , which was heard in the Outer House of Scotland , it was found that a contract was in effect , as attached to the relevant email , even though there was a standard disclaimer .
Copyright
Republication of emails may be protected by copyright law and a disclaimer may warn that such rights to copy the text of the email are reserved by the originator .
Viruses
Computer viruses may be spread by email . To mitigate the risk that a recipient might sue the sender of an infected email , a disclaimer might warn of the possibility of infection and advise the recipient to conduct their own scan . The disclaimer might provide details of the outgoing scanning which has already been performed to provide some guidance about the level of risk .
Effectiveness of disclaimers
The Economist published an article asserting that disclaimers are presented largely as a result of imitation and habit , that people have long stopped paying attention to disclaimers , and suggested that they may not be legally enforceable .
In the United States , the overuse of boilerplate disclaimers by law firms has been criticized as potentially rendering the disclaimers ineffective . With little case law addressing email disclaimers , concerns remain that the use of a disclaimer provides little or no benefit to an attorney other person who misdirects an email that contains privileged or confidential information . If the recipient of a misdirected email is not bound to a confidentiality agreement , the inclusion of a disclaimer has no binding effect upon that person .
In the EU , there is a directive that instructs courts to strike unreasonable provisions of consumer contracts that have not been freely negotiated by the consumer .
Length and other awards
The Register conducted a survey in 2001 and found that UBS Warburg had the longest disclaimer — 1,081 words . Other categories in their Email Disclaimer Awards included the Most Incomprehensible Disclaimer and the Most PC Disclaimer .

The National Council of Canadian Filipino Associations ( NCCFA ) ( ) was an umbrella organization and advocacy group for the Filipino Canadian organizations in Canada . It was officially established in 1983 and registered as a Canadian non-profit organization with headquarters in Ottawa in 1990 . It was dissolved in 2015 .
History
The immediate predecessor to the NCCFA was the United Council of Filipino Associations in Canada ( UCFAC ) founded in 1963 by community leaders in Toronto , Montreal and Vancouver . According to the organization 's 'historique ' , `` the establishment of a national body for Filipino Canadians was first envisioned by Azucena Dulay , President of the Filipino Association in Canada , of Toronto . She brought together Filipino community leaders from Vancouver , Montreal , and Winnipeg for the purpose of forming a national organization . '' Membership to UCFAC comprised representation from Filipino associations across Canada .
The UCFAC held conferences since it was founded . In 1965 , discussions focused on how to improve links in the communities across Canada . In 1971 , the conference announced that `` unity and cooperation among Filipino associations and communities can best be achieved through a cohesive and vigorous national association . '' The 1973 conference took the theme `` The Filipino Identity in our Evolving Multicultural Society . ''
In the early 1980s a distinctively different organization developed in the place of the original one . In 1983 , Dr. Rey Pagtakhan called community leaders from around Canada to his home in Winnipeg where they discussed the possibility of a new formation . As former UCFAC National President and Chair of the Canadian Ethno-cultural Council ( CEC ) , Pagtakhan proposed major changes in the organizational structure that followed other CEC groups had and the federal government 's Multiculturalism program guide . It also ceased relations with the Philippine Consul General as their official adviser . The new organization also included in its mission 'national unity ' . Thus , the UCFAC was revived as the National Council of Canadian Filipino Associations ( NCCFA ) . The NCCFA followed its precursor with similar activities . In 1989 , it organized a national dialogue on Filipino domestic workers during the International Women 's Day celebrations in Toronto .
Along with 37 national ethnic organizations across Canada , NCCFA was a member organization of the Canadian Ethnocultural Council .

The Big Four or the Four Nations refer to the four top Allied powers of World War I and their leaders who met at the Paris Peace Conference in January 1919 . The Big Four is also known as the Council of Four . It was composed of Georges Clemenceau of France , David Lloyd George of the United Kingdom , Vittorio Emanuele Orlando of Italy , and Woodrow Wilson of the United States .
Georges Clemenceau
Georges Benjamin Clemenceau ( French pronunciation : [ ʒɔʁʒ klemɑ̃so ] ; 28 September 1841 – 24 November 1929 ) was a French politician , physician , and journalist . He served as the Prime Minister of France from 1906 to 1909 , and again from 1917 to 1920 .
He is commonly nicknamed `` Le Tigre '' ( The Tiger ) and `` Père-la-Victoire '' ( Father Victory ) for his determination as a wartime leader .
`` Succeeding Paul Painlevé as premier in November 1917 , Clemenceau formed a coalition cabinet in which he was also minister of war . He renewed the dispirited morale of France , persuaded the allies to agree to a unified command , and pushed the war vigorously until the final victory . Leading the French delegation at the Paris Peace Conference , Clemenceau insisted on Germany 's disarmament and was never satisfied with the Versailles Treaty . He was the main antagonist of Woodrow Wilson , whose ideas he viewed as too idealistic . '' For nearly the final year of World War One ( WWI ) , he led France and was one of the major voices behind the Treaty of Versailles at the Paris Peace Conference ( 1919 ) in the aftermath of the war . Clemenceau was hoping that there would be more punishment put on Germany after they lost .
David Lloyd George
David Lloyd George , ( 17 January 1863 – 26 March 1945 ) from the British Liberal Party was a highly effective leader of the coalition government that took power in late 1916 and managed the British war effort . However his coalition premiership was supported more by Conservatives than by his own Liberals , and the subsequent split was a key factor in the decline of the Liberal Party as a serious political force .
He won by a landslide in the election of 1918 , held just after the war ended , where he spoke out for harsh terms against Germany . However , he was much more moderate in Paris . Unlike Clemenceau and Orlando , Lloyd George did not want to destroy the German economy and political system—as Clemenceau demanded—with massive reparations . When asked how he had done at the peace conference , he commented , `` Not badly , considering I was seated between Jesus Christ and Napoleon [ Wilson and Clemenceau ] . ''
It has been said that `` Lloyd George was the most affable and the most resilient , and he was probably the best at negotiating '' . In an article from the New York Times , it says that `` Lloyd George was a pragmatist determined to protect and expand the interests of the British Empire . ''
Vittorio Emanuele Orlando
Vittorio Emanuele Orlando ( 19 May 1860 – 1 December 1952 ) was an Italian diplomat and political figure . He was born in Palermo , Sicily . His father , a landed gentleman , delayed venturing out to register his son 's birth for fear of Giuseppe Garibaldi 's 1,000 patriots who had just stormed into Sicily on the first leg of their march to build an Italian state . He is commonly nicknamed `` The Premier of Victory '' .
In 1897 he was elected in the Italian Chamber of Deputies ( Italian : Camera dei Deputati ) for the district of Partinico for which he was constantly re-elected until 1925 . He aligned himself with Giovanni Giolitti , who was Prime Minister of Italy five times between 1892 and 1921 .
As Prime Minister of Italy , he went to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 . He demanded the fulfilment of the `` secret Treaty of London of 1915 , by which the Allies had promised Italy ample territorial compensation in Dalmatia for its entry into World War I . '' However , Woodrow Wilson brought forth considerable opposition to Orlando 's demands . Therefore , Orlando failed to secure British or French support . This caused him to leave the Peace Conference . However , he returned a month later . `` Even then no solution satisfactory to Italy was found '' ; Orlando resigned and the treaties he negotiated were signed by Francesco Saverio Nitti and Giovanni Giolitti . The so-called `` Mutilated victory '' was used as propaganda in the rise of Benito Mussolini . Opposing Fascism , Orlando gave up ( 1925 ) his seat in parliament and devoted himself to teaching and writing . ''
Aside from his prominent political role , Orlando is also known for his writings , over a hundred works , on legal and judicial issues ; Orlando was himself a professor of law .
He was among the fathers of the Republican Constitution , being a member of the Constitutional Assembly also as speaker of the house . He was a candidate to be the first Italian President elected by the Parliament .
Woodrow Wilson
Woodrow Wilson ( 28 December 1856 – 3 February 1924 ) was elected President of the United States based on domestic issues in 1912 , and re-elected in 1916 . He based his 1916 re-election campaign around the slogan `` he kept us out of war '' , and had worked hard to broker a compromise peace . In early 1917 Berlin decided to launch all-out submarine warfare designed to sink American ships bringing supplies to Britain ; in the Zimmermann Telegram it proposed a military alliance with Mexico to fight a war against the US . The nation was poorly armed when it went to war in April 1917 , but it had millions of potential fresh soldiers , billions of dollars , and huge supplies of raw materials needed by the Allies . Officially Wilson kept the US independent of the Allies .
In 1918 Wilson took personal control of negotiations with Germany , including the armistice . He issued his Fourteen Points , his view of a post-war world that could avoid another terrible conflict . It had an enormous impact on both sides in Europe and made him the man of the hour in Paris . A leader of the Progressive Movement , he assembled a high-powered group of academic advisors to help him in Paris but his distrustful personality led him to break with a series of close advisors , most notably Colonel House . He made a major blunder by refusing to bring along any prominent Republicans to Paris , which politicised the American debate and weakened his support . His main goal was a long-term solution to end warfare based on the League of Nations and self-determination of nations . He paid special attention to creating new nations out of defunct empires and was opposed to harsh terms and reparations imposed on Germany . A Presbyterian of deep religious faith , Wilson appealed to a gospel of service and infused a profound sense of moralism into his idealistic internationalism , now referred to as `` Wilsonianism '' . Wilsonianism calls for the United States to enter the world arena to fight for democracy , and has been a contentious position in American foreign policy .
Purpose
While the Allies at the Paris Peace Conference made up more than twenty nations , the Big Four entered Versailles and were leading architects of the Treaty of Versailles which was signed by Germany ; the Treaty of St. Germain , with Austria ; the Treaty of Neuilly , with Bulgaria ; the Treaty of Trianon , with Hungary ; and the Treaty of Sèvres , with the Ottoman Empire . At one point Orlando temporarily pulled out of the conference because Italian demands were not met , leaving the other three countries as the sole major architects of the talk , referred to as the `` Big Three '' . The Italian delegation returned after 11 days .

Samuel M. Plato ( 1882–1957 ) was an American architect and building contractor who is noted for his work on federal housing projects and U.S. post offices , as well as designing and building other structures in the United States such as private homes , banks , churches , and schools . During World War II , the Alabama native was one of the few African-American contractors in the country to be awarded wartime building contracts , which included Wake and Midway Halls ( dormitories for more than 800 African-American defense workers in Washington , D.C. ) . He also received contracts to build at least thirty-eight U.S. post offices across the country .
Plato began his career as an architect and building contractor in 1902 in Marion , Indiana , at a time when segregation and racism made it challenging for African-American professionals such as architects . In 1921 he relocated to Louisville , Kentucky , where he spent the remainder of his life . Some of Plato 's major buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places . These include Louisville 's Broadway Temple A.M.E. Zion Church and the Virginia Avenue Colored School , two examples of his contributions to the city 's African-American community . Other projects include the J. Woodrow Wilson House in Marion , Indiana , and the Second Baptist Church in Bloomington , Indiana .
Early life and education
Samuel M. Plato was born in 1882 Waugh in Montgomery County , Alabama , to James and Katie ( Hendricks ) Plato . Samuel 's father , James , was a farmer who taught him carpentry and other construction trades .
Plato graduated from Mount Meigs Colored Institute near his home in Alabama and spent an additional year studying at Winston-Salem , North Carolina , before enrolling in 1898 at State University Normal School ( present-day Simmons College of Kentucky ) in Louisville , Kentucky . He began working at construction sites during summer breaks while still in college and graduated in 1902 . He also completed a mail-order program in architecture from the International Correspondence Schools of Scranton , Pennsylvania .
Career
Plato began working as a building contractor in the early 1900s , when discrimination against African Americans often relegated them to jobs as unskilled laborers . Despite these challenges , he found work as a carpenter , but refused to settle on this labor-intensive work . Instead , he chose to pursue a career as an architect and building contractor , which provided better employment opportunities and potential pay . Plato was a pioneer African-American architect in the Midwest . Around 1902 , soon after his graduation from college , he moved to Marion , Indiana , where he spent nineteen years as an architect and building contractor before returning to Louisville , Kentucky , around 1921 . In addition to projects in Indiana and Kentucky , Plato designed and built other structures across the United States .
Indiana projects
During his year in Indiana , at a time when the Ku Klux Klan reached an all-time record half a million members in the state , Plato found support from wealthy business owners John Schaumleffel and J. Woodrow Wilson . Plato also had a partnership for about ten years with Jasper Burden , a black building contractor in Marion . Plato 's early projects in Marion include the Second Baptist Church , completed in 1905 ; the Classical Revival-style First Baptist Church , commissioned in 1913 ; and the Platonian Apartments , built in 1910 .
One of Plato 's best-known residential projects was designing and building the fifteen-room J. Woodrow Wilson House in Marion in 1912 . The Neoclassical-style home was `` one of the finest structures in the city '' and reportedly cost $ 135,000 at the time of its construction . Wilson House ( also known as the Wilson-Vaughan Home and the Hostess House ) was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988 .
Plato received contracts to design and build other private residences and commercial buildings in Marion and elsewhere in Indiana . Examples of his work include the First United Baptist Church in Wabash and the Second Baptist Church ( added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983 ) in Bloomington , Indiana . Another project was the Swallow-Robin residence hall , which was built in 1917 on the Taylor University campus in Upland , Indiana .
While working in Marion , Plato became known for providing employment opportunities for blacks and whites on his construction projects at a time when it was a rare practice for black businessmen to hire white workers in the early decades of the twentieth century . According to a 1928 national survey that was published in the 1931-32 Negro Year Book , less than 1.2 percent of black-owned businesses employed white workers . Plato 's practice of hiring African-American workers for his projects , especially for work that required skilled labor , gave them a chance to improve their skills . His efforts were also successful in opening the building trade unions to African-American workers .
Kentucky projects
Plato left Marion around 1920 or 1921 to return to Louisville , Kentucky , where he continued his career as an architect and builder . His major projects in the Louisville area include the Broadway Temple A.M.E. Zion Church ( added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 ) and the James Lee Memorial Presbyterian Church . Plato also designed the Virginia Avenue Colored School ( added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2004 ) . and Simmons College of Kentucky 's Steward Hall , a part of the school 's Municipal College Campus ( added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976 ) , as well as two banks in Louisville . A residential area that Plato helped develop was named Plato Terrace in his honor . Around 1945 he helped to establish the city 's Westover subdivision of small , two-bedroom houses .
Federal government projects
Plato is best known for his work on federal housing projects and reportedly became the first African-American to be awarded a contract to build a U.S. post office . He was awarded contracts , mostly in the 1930s , to build at least 38 U.S. post offices in towns such as Coldwater , Ohio ; Goshen , New York ; Fredonia , New York ; Eaton , New York ; Morgantown , West Virginia ; and Decatur , Alabama . Officials hired Plato to work on the post office in Decatur without realizing he was black . To avoid a potentially unpleasant situation , he skipped the welcome party and immediately went to work on the project . Other federal government projects included a government building in New Philadelphia , Ohio , and contracts to build federal armories in Xenia and Zanesville , Ohio .
Plato 's federal government housing projects for defense workers during World War II brought him national attention . Between 1941 and 1946 , Plato was one of the few African-American architects and contractors in the United States to be awarded wartime contracts . Although President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802 in June 1941 prohibiting discriminatory practices in defense jobs and in awarding federal defense contracts during World War II , national defense industries continued to discriminate against African Americans and overlooked black businesses in awarding federal government contracts . Plato 's defense workers housing projects include Wake and Midway Halls , which were dormitories to accommodate more than 800 African-American defense workers in Washington , D.C. Another of his federal housing projects was Sparrows Point , a 304-unit complex in Baltimore , Maryland .
Community service
In addition to his architectural career , Plato was active in several civic organizations that included the Young Women 's Christian Association , the National Urban League , and the National Negro Business League . Plato was a member of Phi Beta Sigma fraternity 's Epsilon Beta Sigma alumni chapter . He also served as vice president of the National Negro Builders Association in 1927 . In addition , Plato was in demand as a speaker at the Tuskegee Institute , the Hampton Institute , and a special lecturer at Howard University 's School of Engineering and Architecture .
Marriage and family
Few details are known of Plato 's personal life . His first wife , Nettie Plato , is buried at Marion , Indiana . His second wife , Elnora Davis Lucas Plato ( 1891–1975 ) `` built her own successful dressmaking business '' before marrying Plato while he was a resident of Marion . She also used funds from her business earnings to help her husband and was `` his constant travel companion and business manager . '' Around 1929 , Samuel built a modified Tudor Revival-style home for himself and his wife in the Russell neighborhood of Louisville , Kentucky .
Plato believed in helping others and devoting himself to his family . `` In 1939 he devised a plan to move his sister and her family off the old homestead in Waugh , Alabama , and into a new home nearby . '' Elnora Plato `` funded the cost of Samuel 's sister 's new house in Waugh and `` on more than one occasion , she was able to keep heir [ sic ] company from going bankrupt . '' Samuel and Elnora Plato also `` helped put several nieces and nephews though college and graduate school . '' In addition , he employed `` some of them on jobs in Louisville and Washington , D.C .
Death and legacy
Plato died in May 1957 in Louisville , Kentucky . He was a nationally-recognized as a pioneer an African-American architect and builder during the early 20th century . He began his career at a time when segregation and racism made it challenging for African-American professionals such as architects . Plato `` was admired and respected '' in the community . He once commented , `` My whole goal in life has been to improve and help others who come up behind me . '' According to his wife , Elnora Plato , he `` was a pioneer for years and he wanted his business to live . Then , too , he wanted to inspire young engineers . ''
Historians attribute Plato 's successful career was due to his persistent efforts and his reputation for quality and integrity . His work was recognized in newspapers , the Negro Year Book , and Ebony magazine , among other publications . After visiting Wake and Midway Halls , two of his wartime federal defense workers ' housing projects , First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt wrote about them in her newspaper column , `` My Day , '' on May 20 , 1943 .
Plato designed and built a variety of structures in buildings Alabama , Indiana , Kentucky , Maryland , New York , Ohio , Pennsylvania , West Virginia , and Washington D.C . He is reportedly the first African American to design a U.S. post office and is credited with receiving contracts to build at least thirty-eight post offices across the United States . His work also included `` Greek Revival and Craftsman-style houses '' and `` elegant mansions , '' as well as `` banks , churches , schools , office buildings , theaters , '' and `` federal government housing projects . '' At least eight of his projects are listed on the National Register of Historic Places . These include the Broadway Temple A.M.E. Zion Church and the Virginia Avenue Colored School in Louisville , Kentucky ; the J. Woodrow Wilson House at Marion , Indiana ; and the Second Baptist Church in Bloomington , Indiana , among others .
Honors and awards
Howard University 's School of Engineering and Architecture , where Plato had been special lecturer , honored him posthumously in 1960 .
The Indiana Historical Bureau dedicated a state historical marker in Plato 's honor on July 25 , 2015 , in front of the J. Woodrow Wilson House ( Hostess House ) in Marion , Indiana .
A Kentucky state historical marker dedicated to Plato was erected in front of Broadway Temple A.M.E. Zion Church in Louisville , Kentucky , and dedicated in February 1919 .

The Frasnes Hoard was accidentally unearthed in 1864 by foresters digging out the roots of a tree near Frasnes-lez-Buissenal in Hainaut , Belgium . The torcs and some other pieces are now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York .
Along with at least eighty uninscribed coins of types often found in Gaul and Britain and associated with the Belgic tribes of Morini and Nervii , which were dated by John Evans to ca . 80 BC , the hoard discovered at Frasnes also contained two characteristically Gallic Late La Tène style gold torcs , one plain with flattened-ball terminals , the other with repoussé decoration of a frontal bull 's head among raised facetted scrolls some of which manifested a design repertory comparable to finds in Britain . The torc was constructed of sheet gold over an iron ring wrapped in a hard cement . There was also a ring `` nearly 1⅝ inches in diameter '' , too large in diameter to be a finger ring , yet too small to be a bracelet or armband ; it had continuous granular ornament of globules of gold soldered together round into outer face .

Marshall Bang , known professionally as MRSHLL ( ) , is a Korean-American R & B and K-pop singer .
Early life
Born and raised in a conservative Christian home in Orange County , California , Bang started developing his affinity for music and singing in church . He further explored his performing sensibilities in his high school show choir and local community theater productions . After graduating , Bang attended private Christian institution Biola University , where he began to post singing videos online such as his cover of Boyz II Men 's `` It 's So Hard To Say Goodbye To Yesterday '' that went viral . Post-college , Bang was diagnosed with laryngopharyngeal reflux , where he eventually had to quit singing and decided to enroll in cosmetology school in Los Angeles . A formative time in his life , this was when he was properly introduced to queer culture and the LGBTQIA+ community at large . After receiving his license , Bang eventually moved to New York City to further his career in the beauty industry .
Career
While Bang had moved to New York City and given up his music career due to his throat condition , a South Korean television producer from Seoul found his online cover videos and invited him to compete on national Korean television singing competition show , The Great Rebirth – Star Audition : The Next Big Thing 3 in 2012 . Though it hurt to sing , his condition gradually improved throughout the show and Bang decided to remain in South Korea after the show to pursue his singing career .
Bang began performing under the moniker MRSHLL ( pronounced `` Marshall '' ) in 2016 and officially debuted as a credited featured artist on two songs off of DJ friz 's debut EP , The Record , Vol . R in March 2017 . Bang signed to Seoul-based boutique record label Feel Ghood Music ( home to Korean hip hop pioneers Tiger JK and Yoonmirae , and R & B singer-songwriter BIBI ) and made his official solo debut as MRSHLL in June 2017 with two songs – `` Circle '' and `` Home '' – on Feel Ghood Music 's compilation album , FeelGhood . A few months later , Bang made his national Korean television debut as MRSHLL on popular hip hop competition show , Show Me The Money ( Season 6 ) ; where he co-wrote , featured , and performed with Woo Won Jae , Tiger JK , and Bizzy . The song T.O ( Again ) – released in August 2017 – ended up reaching the Top 40 charts in South Korea .
In June 2018 , Bang released his first EP project Breathe , consisting of 6 songs including the title track `` Come Over ( featuring pH-1 ) and the disco dance anthem “ Pose ” . In October 2018 , he released his second EP and first mixtape , Alien ( Issa Mixtape ) .
Bang parted ways with Feel Ghood Music in early 2019 and made a comeback as an independent artist with the single Mirage in January 2020 . In subsequent years , Bang has steadily released singles , mini-albums , and been in campaigns for Instagram , instax , and Converse and penned songs for other artists , such as co-writing Verivery 's 2022 title track Undercover and 88rising ( with Rich Brian and BIBI , and featuring Warren Hue ) 's froyo . Bang continues to release solo music with his 90s/2000s R & B concept EP , XYZ in October 2021 . Writing for Harper 's Bazaar , Chyenne Tatum listed the EP as one of the top 15 K-pop albums of 2021 .
Personal life
Bang is openly gay . He first came out to his family before moving to New York City but publicly came out in a Time Out Seoul interview in 2015 . He is known as the first openly gay singer in K-Pop , debuting in 2017 . Though Bang 's friends warned that coming out would be “ social suicide '' ( as it is still very taboo in Korean culture ) , Bang decided to be open with his sexuality from the start as he feels it is nothing to be ashamed of . In spite of the fact that his parents are not accepting , Bang is fully supported by his brothers and his chosen family .

During the 1965–66 English football season , Brentford competed in the Football League Third Division . After an awful first half of the season , Brentford dropped into the relegation places in January 1966 and failed to recover , ending the club 's three-season spell in the Third Division .
Season summary
The lack of incoming transfer activity during the 1965 off-season served to highlight the view at Griffin Park that Brentford 's squad was strong enough to secure promotion to the Second Division during the 1965–66 season . The campaign began with a rousing 6–1 victory over local rivals Queens Park Rangers at Griffin Park , courtesy of goals from John Fielding , Joe Bonson , Ian Lawther and a Micky Block hat-trick . The win gave way to three defeats and a draw in the following four matches , but consecutive victories over Shrewsbury Town and Swansea Town in mid-September proved to be a false drawn . Brentford would win just one more league match before the end of 1965 and the team 's plight was worsened by the departures of influential attackers Jimmy Bloomfield , Mark Lazarus and John Fielding after disputes with manager Tommy Cavanagh . Outside forward John Docherty was bought back from Sheffield United for his second spell at Griffin Park in December 1965 , but Brentford began 1966 entrenched in the relegation places .
Misfiring forward Joe Bonson was sold in January 1966 and though manager Cavanagh was provided with the funds to purchase replacement forwards Brian Etheridge , John Regan and Bobby Ross , the new signings failed to help the team convert draws into all-important wins , with four matches being drawn in March . Three consecutive defeats in early April left the supporters clamouring for Cavanagh 's head and despite a brief respite after a 2–0 victory over Brighton & Hove Albion , a 5–0 defeat away to Exeter City on 16 April led chairman Jack Dunnett to dispense with Cavanagh 's services . Youth team manager Ian Black won , drew and lost each of the following three matches in a caretaker capacity , before Billy Gray was appointed as manager .
Gray began his reign with Brentford in 23rd place and three points from safety with five matches remaining . A 3–0 home defeat to Mansfield Town in his first match in charge effectively ended all survival hopes after the gap to safety opened up to five points . A draw and a win versus Watford and Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic respectively in the following two matches put the Bees back within two points of safety , but defeats in the final two matches of the season sealed the club 's relegation to the Fourth Division .
Three club records were set or equalled during the season :
Most away Football League games without a win : 21 ( 24 April 1965 – 16 April 1966 )
Record home Football League defeat : 0–5 versus Bristol Rovers , 5 February 1966
First substitute to be utilised : Hugh McLaughlin ( replaced Billy Cobb versus Oldham Athletic , Third Division , 23 October 1965 )

The book collects de Camp 's classic novel Lest Darkness Fall , an afterword concerning its significance by Alexei and Cory Panshin , and tales responding to it by the other authors .
Contents
Lest Darkness Fall by L. Sprague de Camp . A shorter version first appeared in the magazine Unknown v. 11 , no . 4 , December 1939 ; expanded to novel length , it was first published in book form by Henry Holt and Company in 1941 . There have been numerous editions since . Martin Padway , an American archeologist visiting Rome in 1938 , is struck by lightning at the Pantheon and finds himself transported back in time to the Rome of 535 AD . In that period the Western Roman Empire has long since fallen , and for nearly sixty years Italy has been ruled by barbarians , currently the Ostrogoths . However , the Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire is poised to invade and reconquer the peninsula in a ruinous war Padway knows from history will devastate the country and mark the onset of the Dark Ages . To ensure his own survival and prevent the impending collapse of civilization , he sets out to introduce technical innovations from his own time . As Italy is invaded , he also becomes involved in political and military affairs , becoming the power behind the Ostrogothic throne and defeating the Byzantines . By the end of the novel Padway has stabilized the Italo-Gothic kingdom and consolidated his reforms . Due to his actions , Europe will not experience the Dark Ages , and darkness will not fall .
`` L. Sprague de Camp 's Great Leap of Imagination '' by Alexei and Cory Panshin . The Panshins ' afterword was adapted from material on de Camp in The World Beyond the Hill , their 1989 history of the science fiction field through the golden age .
`` The Deadly Mission of Phineas Snodgrass '' by Frederik Pohl first appeared in Galaxy Magazine v. 20 , no . 5 , June 1962 . In this tale , the title character travels back to 1 BC and teaches modern medicine , causing a population explosion . It ends with the fantastically overpopulated alternate timeline sending someone back to assassinate Snodgrass , allowing darkness to fall for thankful trillions .
`` The Apotheosis of Martin Padway '' by S. M. Stirling , first appeared in Harry Turtledove 's 2005 tribute anthology honoring L. Sprague de Camp , The Enchanter Completed . A direct sequel to Lest Darkness Fall , it provides interesting glimpses of what might have become of the reality Padway altered , both during his old age and a few hundred years later . By 585 A.D. , fifty years since Padway came on the scene , a full-fledged Industrial Revolution is taking place , centered on Italy but fast spreading elsewhere ; the Western Roman Empire has been revived under the Gothic Emperors , fully regaining all its European territories and embarking on the colonization of North America - with a political and economic situation roughly comparable to 19th Century Britain . Padway , in his eighties , is still the highly energetic power behind the throne . But to the east , the Byzantine Empire had kept pace , obtained for itself the new firearms `` invented '' by Padway , embarked on massive conquests all the way to Sogdiana ( Afghanistan ) and the persecution of Zoroastrians and Buddhists - and still entertains schemes of westward conquest . Byzantine agents , infiltrating the western capital Florence , embark on a mass campaign of riots and sabotage . Some of them pursue Padway , whom they find in a carriage with his favorite granddaughter . Escaping into an abandoned building and chased by a Byzantine-led mob , Padway decides to sacrifice himself , letting a young officer take the granddaughter to safety while the Byzantines start a fire which seems set to roast Padway within minutes - but time travelers from the further future save him in a very spectacular way , the Apotheosis of the title . Once inside their timeship , Padway discovers that they came from the Tenth Century - not the Viking Age Tenth Century with which Padway was familiar , but rather a Tenth Century possessing a super-science far beyond the Twentieth Century from which Padway originally came . His effort to change history was a success far greater than he ever dared dream .
`` To Bring the Light '' by David Drake , originally published together with de Camp 's novel in the 1996 Baen double Lest Darkness Fall / To Bring The Light . This story features Flavia Herosilla , a well-educated woman living in Imperial Rome , watching a procession headed by the Emperor Philip the Arab - when a sudden thunderstorm breaks out . Like Padway , she is sent back in time by a lightning strike , in her case to the era of Rome 's beginnings around 751 BC . It takes her some time to understand that the rolling green hills she sees are the Seven Hills of Rome , which she had known completely built up and covered with palaces and tenements . Among the rude shepherds living in a tiny village on top of Palatine Hill are people which she always considered as myth and whose historical veracity she had doubted . But they are all too real , one of them trying to rape her and needing to be fought off by tricks she had learned from a Bactrian wrestler . Finding her feet in this archaic setting , Flavia is able to use her sophisticated urban knowledge to manipulate and overawe the villagers , and is soon in a position to organize and implement a bloody regime change in Alba Longa - a minor provincial town by Flavia 's Imperial Roman standards , but the crucial hub of local power in the here-and-now . Unlike Padway , who tried to change history , Flavia simply seeks to make sure that the Founding of Rome would take place on schedule and that the legends that she knows would come true . But there is one detail she does want to change . The legends tell that on the day of Rome 's founding , Romulus killed his brother Remus - and while in the process of making sure that Rome will be founded , Flavia Herosilla had fallen in love with Remus ...
`` Temporal Discontinuity '' by David Weber ( second edition only ) , newly commissioned for the second edition . Another direct sequel to Lest Darkness Fall , but incompatible with Stirling 's `` The Apotheosis of Martin Padway . '' This one also involves a future time-traveler investigating Padway 's temporal disruptions , only she thinks he 's a criminal from her own time who set out to change the timeline on purpose -- a crime punishable by death . When agent Yawen Clasen-Hamatti confronts Padway in person , she discovers her mistake -- and has a moral dilemma on her hands .
`` The Fake Pandemic '' by Harry Turtledove ( second edition only ) , newly commissioned for the second edition . Also a direct sequel to Lest Darkness Fall , compatible with Stirling 's but not Weber 's . Padway recruits the Byzantine jurist Tribonian in an effort to prevent the Plague of Justinian . The story follows Tribonian as he proceeds to secure the emperor Justinian I 's permission and support to do just that , and follows him on his successful if thankless mission ( Justinian may be supportive , but he is far from grateful ) .

In mathematics , a superior highly composite number is a natural number which has the highest ratio of its number of divisors to some positive power of itself than any other number . It is a stronger restriction than that of a highly composite number , which is defined as having more divisors than any smaller positive integer .
The first 10 superior highly composite numbers and their factorization are listed .
For a superior highly composite number n there exists a positive real number ε such that for all natural numbers k smaller than n we have
and for all natural numbers k larger than n we have
where d ( n ) , the divisor function , denotes the number of divisors of n. The term was coined by Ramanujan ( 1915 ) .
For example , the number with the most divisors per square root of the number itself is 12 ; this can be demonstrated using some highly composites near 12 .
120 is another superior highly composite number because it has the highest ratio of divisors to itself raised to the .4 power .
The first 15 superior highly composite numbers , 2 , 6 , 12 , 60 , 120 , 360 , 2520 , 5040 , 55440 , 720720 , 1441440 , 4324320 , 21621600 , 367567200 , 6983776800 are also the first 15 colossally abundant numbers , which meet a similar condition based on the sum-of-divisors function rather than the number of divisors . Neither set , however , is a subset of the other .
Properties
All superior highly composite numbers are highly composite . This is easy to prove : if there is some number k that has the same number of divisors as n but is less than n itself ( i.e . , but ) , then for all positive ε , so if a number `` n '' is not highly composite , it can not be superior highly composite .
An effective construction of the set of all superior highly composite numbers is given by the following monotonic mapping from the positive real numbers . Let
for any prime number p and positive real x . Then
is a superior highly composite number .
Note that the product need not be computed indefinitely , because if then , so the product to calculate can be terminated once .
Also note that in the definition of , is analogous to in the implicit definition of a superior highly composite number .
Moreover , for each superior highly composite number exists a half-open interval such that .
This representation implies that there exist an infinite sequence of such that for the n-th superior highly composite number holds
The first are 2 , 3 , 2 , 5 , 2 , 3 , 7 , ... . In other words , the quotient of two successive superior highly composite numbers is a prime number .
Superior highly composite radices
The first few superior highly composite numbers have often been used as radices , due to their high divisibility for their size . For example :
Binary ( base 2 )
Senary ( base 6 )
Duodecimal ( base 12 )
Sexagesimal ( base 60 )
Bigger SHCNs can be used in other ways . 120 appears as the long hundred , while 360 appears as the number of degrees in a circle .

Theotokos Uralskaya ( Our Lady of the Urals ) is the Russian Orthodox Marian icon locally venerated in Ekaterinburg and Urals .
According to Ekaterinburg Eparchy , the image of the icon appeared on January 9 , 2003 , in a dream of a parishioner named Ekaterina ( no further information is given about her ) . The image `` became live '' and told the woman that Virgin Mary `` protects Ural Land '' and instructed her to tell people about that and to ask for painting of the icon . She told it to clergy of a local church dedicated to Seraphim of Sarov who supported the idea and later it was approved by Eparchy leader of that time , Vikentiy , who organized the painting and consecration of the image . Later it was also supported by visiting major Moscow clergy from Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church .
The painting was accomplished by an unnamed icon painter in 9 months . The icon is a classical Hodegetria type icon that Russian church also classifies as Kazanskaya-type . There are Virgin Mary and Baby Jesus , and distinctive features of the icon are fir-tree branch covered by snow and a snowflake .

Bonkers ! is a British television variety show from ATV , and distributed by ITC Entertainment in the United States for syndication during the 1978–79 television season . The show aired later in 1979 on ITV in the United Kingdom . A total of 24 episodes were produced . The show was filmed at ATV 's Elstree studios near London .
Starring Bob Monkhouse and the Hudson Brothers – Bill , Brett and Mark – the show featured sketches , guest stars and musical numbers from the chorus dancers known as The Bonkerettes . While not a big hit for ATV , it gained a cult audience in the United States where it was compared to Saturday Night Live .
After four episodes the show was curtailed in the United Kingdom by the 13-week-long ITV strike of 1979 . When ITV returned only a small number of companies mainly Border Television , ATV , Granada and UTV broadcast a few additional episodes , however the series was not fully broadcast in the United Kingdom .

The Acadian flycatcher ( Empidonax virescens ) is a small insect-eating bird of the tyrant flycatcher family .
Description
Adults have olive upperparts , darker on the wings and tail , with whitish underparts ; they have a white eye ring , white wing bars and a wide bill . The breast is washed with olive . The upper part of the bill is dark ; the lower part is yellowish . This bird 's song is an explosive peet-sa . The call is a soft peet . They also have a call similar to that of the northern flicker A unique two-note song described as `` ka-zeep '' , and its location in its preferred habitat , are two features that help to identify this species .
Measurements :
Length : 5.5-5.9 in ( 14-15 cm )
Weight : 0.4-0.5 oz ( 11.1-13.9 g )
Wingspan : 8.7-9.1 in ( 22-23 cm )
Taxonomy
The 15 species of this genus were once all thought to be a single species , which was discovered in Acadia in present-day Nova Scotia . Differences in range , voice , and habitat eventually identified them as separate species . The present-day `` Acadian flycatcher '' is not found in Acadia .
Distribution
Its breeding habitat is deciduous forests , often near water , across the eastern United States and southwestern Ontario . These birds migrate through eastern Mexico and the Caribbean to southern Central America and the very northwest of South America in Colombia , western Venezuela , and Ecuador .
The numbers of these birds have declined somewhat in the southern parts of their range . Brown-headed cowbirds lay eggs in the nests of these birds in some areas . However , only 16 % of cowbird young in Acadian flycatcher nests fledge successfully .
They wait on a perch in the middle of a tree and fly out to catch insects in flight ( hawking ) , also sometimes picking insects from foliage while hovering ( gleaning ) . They may eat some berries and seeds .
They make a loose cup nest in a horizontal fork in a tree or shrub .
The Acadian flycatcher is an excellent flier ; it is extremely maneuverable , can hover , and can even fly backward . Curiously , there is no scientific information on hopping or walking by this bird .
As of October 2015 there have been 2 records of Acadian flycatcher in Europe , the first being a bird found dead in Iceland in 1967 , and the second a bird found on the beach at Dungeness in Kent , England in September 2015 , the latter 's identity being established by DNA from its droppings .

Royston `` Roy '' Goodacre is Chair in Biological Chemistry at the University of Liverpool . With training in both Microbiology and Pyrolysis-Mass Spectrometry , Goodacre runs a multidisciplinary Metabolomics and Raman spectroscopy research group in the Institute of Systems , Molecular and Integrative Biology ( ISMIB ) , and leads ISMIB 's Centre for Metabolomics Research and the Laboratory for Bioanalytical Spectroscopy .
Early life and education
Goodacre was born in Changi , Singapore , and was educated from 1978 at the Monmouth School , in Wales , where he went on to study Biology , Chemistry and Mathematics at ' A ' level . He received a 2i-class honours degree in Microbiology from the University of Bristol , where he was a student at Badock Hall Halls of residence at the University of Bristol , and remained to study for a PhD in pyrolysis-MS for bacterial identification with the bacteriologist Dr Roger Berkeley at the University of Bristol , defending his thesis in 1992 . While in Bristol he met his wife : they married in 1991 , celebrating 30 years of marriage in 2021 , and have one daughter .
Career
Following his PhD , Goodacre took up a postdoctoral research position at Aberystwyth University between 1992 and 1995 , and began his own research laboratory in 1995 , with the award of a Wellcome Trust Research Career Development Fellowship , which he held until 1999 , when he received tenure as a lecturer in Microbiology at Aberystwyth University . He moved to UMIST , which merged to become the University of Manchester , first as Reader in Analytical Science ( Dept . of Chemistry , 2003–05 ) and then as Professor of Biological Chemistry , from 2005–2018 . Goodacre was then recruited to the University of Liverpool to become Director of the Centre for Metabolomics Research ( 2018- ) .
Goodacre is the founder and current Editor-in-Chief of the peer-reviewed scientific journal Metabolomics . He is an Editorial Advisory Board member for the following journals : Analyst ( 2014- ) ; Journal of Analytical and Applied Pyrolysis ( 1997- ) ; Spectrochimica Acta A : Molecular and Biomolecular Spectroscopy ( 2016- ) .
Goodacre is a Founder and Director of the Metabolomics Society ( 2005–15 , 2020–22 ) and ( since 2008 ) a Director of the Metabolic Profiling Forum .
He served as a Committee member of Royal Society of Chemistry 's Analytical Division Council ( 2019-22 ) .
Since 2019 Goodacre has been a Trustee of the Analytical Chemistry Trust Fund ( ACTF ) .
Goodacre has supervised , and graduated , 53 PhD , 7 MSc and 2 MPhil postgraduate students .
Awards and honours
The Nils Foss Excellence Prize 2021 .
FACSS Charles Mann Award for Applied Raman Spectroscopy ( 2021 ) .
RSC Analytical Division Horizon Prize : Robert Boyle Prize for Analytical Science ( 2021 ) .
The Analytical Scientist Power Lists in 2019 , 2020 and 2021 .
RSC Bioanalytical Chemistry Award ( 2005 ) .
Recipient of the Third Professor S. Ramaseshan Distinguished Lecture . AstraZeneca Research Foundation India , Bangalore , India ( 2004 ) .
Research
Goodacre started Metabolomics research in the early 2000s with Douglas Kell . He helped to develop long-term metabolomics which allows fusion of GC-MS and LC-MS data collected over 12–24 months - which is based on mathematical corrections which effectively removes any ( unavoidable ) chromatographic and mass spectrometry instrumental drift . This approach has been applied to generate profiles from ~1200 normal human serum samples and to investigate human frailty in ageing populations of approx . 2000 individuals .
Standardisation in Metabolomics is important and Goodacre was part of the Metabolomics Standards Initiative ( MSI ) which help establish metabolite identification reporting standards , which have been very well adopted by the field . He chaired part of the MSI 's data analysis workgroup and these minimum reporting standards were published .
Goodacre was the first to show that surface-enhanced Raman scattering can be used for bacterial identification and to use Spatially Offset Raman spectroscopy for through-container authentication of spirit drinks .
As of 2020 , Goodacre has authored two international patents , published > 400 peer-reviewed research articles and has an H-index of over 100 ( see Google Scholar ) , and edited two books on metabolomics .
Goodacre is known for innovative science teaching and scholarship , including the incorporation of music into formal lecture schedules , partly to aid mental well-being .

Pentecostalism is a renewal movement within Protestant Christianity that places special emphasis on a direct personal experience of God through the baptism with the Holy Spirit . For Christians , this event commemorates the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the followers of Jesus Christ , as described in the second chapter of the Book of Acts .
Pentecostalism was established in Kerala , India at the start of the 20th century .
History
Indigenous Pentecostalism in India first emerged from the Syrian Christian community in the state of Kerala . Christianity in Kerala claims its origin in AD 52 when the Apostle Thomas arrived and preached the gospel to Jews . In addition , there were evidences of migrations of Christians from Syria in the fourth century and the eighth century to Kerala .
The Pentecostal message from the West arrived in Kerala in 1909 through the visit of George Berg . This American missionary of German descent arrived in Bangalore in 1909 and preached in a convention in Kerala . The first Pentecostal congregation was formed through the efforts of Berg in Kerala only in 1911 ; this was among first generation Christians . Berg was the first missionary to reach out to the natives who did not speak English .
In 1913 Pastor Robert F. Cook also came to India as a missionary . He came to Kerala and began his ministry there in 1914 . By 1923 , Cook had established 36 churches in Kerala , known collectively as the South India Church of God ( Full Gospel ) in India . Pastor K. E. Abraham , who was associated with Pastor Cook until 1930 , was baptized in the Holy Spirit in 1923 , an event considered as the foundation for the establishment of the India Pentecostal Church of God . In 1930 , Pastor K.E Abraham who believed that local Keralite churches must be independent from foreign organizations for effective evangelization within India , split from Pastor Cook and formed the South India Pentecostal Church of God . He later changed the name of the church to India Pentecostal Church of God .
In addition to the work begun by Abraham , Pentecostalism grew rapidly in Kerala through the ministries of the Ceylon Pentecostal Mission ( CPM ) , the Church of God ( Cleveland ) , and the Assemblies of God .

In classical Pentecostalism , the baptism with the Holy Spirit is understood to be a separate and distinct experience occurring sometime after regeneration . Influenced by the Holiness movement , baptism with the Holy Spirit was regarded by the first Pentecostals as being the third work of grace , following the new birth ( first work of grace ) and entire sanctification ( second work of grace ) .
John Wesley , the founder of the Methodist movement , taught that there were two distinct phases in the Christian experience . In the first work of grace , the new birth , the believer received forgiveness and became a Christian . During the second work of grace , sanctification , the believer was purified and made holy . Wesley taught both that sanctification could be an instantaneous experience , and that it could be a gradual process .
Early Methodists wore plain dress , with Methodist clergy condemning `` high headdresses , ruffles , laces , gold , and 'costly apparel ' in general '' . John Wesley recommended that Methodists annually read his thoughts On Dress ; in that sermon , John Wesley expressed his desire for Methodists : `` Let me see , before I die , a Methodist congregation , full as plain dressed as a Quaker congregation '' . The 1858 Discipline of the Wesleyan Methodist Connection thus stated that `` we would ... ejoin on all who fear God plain dress '' .
Outward Holiness , or External Holiness , is a Wesleyan-Arminian doctrine emphasizing modest dress and sober speech . The doctrine was prevalent during the revival movements for the early Lutheran Pietists and Methodists , and during the Holiness and Pentecostal movements . Some Christian denominations within the Wesleyan-Arminian theological tradition , such as some Methodist , Holiness , and Pentecostal denominations continue to observe outward holiness .
The standards are :
Modest and plain dress , which is defined as loose covering from the neck to below the knee in all normal body postures ; women often wear a Christian headcovering . This would also include the strict prohibition of mixed bathing .
Moderate or no use of jewelry or ornaments of gold , silver , and jewels for personal adornment ; some denominations will only allow the use of a wedding band or ring while others proscribe it too .
A distinction of the sexes in clothing , forbidding such style as trousers and pantsuits for women unless required by work or public service .
Christian men are to wear their hair short and Christian women must never cut or remove their hair , wearing it long in order to have a definitive distinction of male and female sexes .
As a continuation , in Kerala many Traditional Pentecostal denominations do not wear ornaments depending upon the denomination they are part of . However Dr. Valsan Abraham who is the current president of IPC Church has mentioned that removing ornaments is not a part of Biblical doctrine but the forefathers of IPC CHURCH had decided to have a simple lifestyle and the practice of removing ornaments has never ever recorded in the constitution of IPC and in the statement of faith . Most of the Independent churches in Kerala do not have a practice of removing ornaments . At the turn of the century , more and more traditional churches are moving away from the practice of mandating compulsory removal of ornaments and classifying it as a personal choice of believers .

Resistance of Pentecostalism in Kerala
The US-based persecution watchdog International Christian Concern ( ICC ) has learned some attacks on Christians in Kerala , generally considered a safe-haven for Christians because of the large Christian minority there . The ICC warned that the Kerala attacks would only embolden anti-Christian extremists elsewhere to attack the even more vulnerable Christians in their states .
The Vishwa Hindu Parishad along with the Arya Samaj arranged the Ghar Wapsi Program and converted a few number of Christians to Hinduism in Kerala . Because Dalit Christians had belonged to SC/ST communities before conversion to Christianity , but they are denied the government 's SC/ST benefits in education and job reservation . The Supreme Court ruled that a person who reconverts from Christianity to Hinduism shall be entitled to reservation benefits if his forefathers belonged to a Scheduled Caste and the community accepts him after reconversion .

The Lucas Awards ( Spanish : Premios Lucas ) are awarded in Cuba for best music video . Once a year , generally in November , the nominees are announced . The program was created by Orlando Cruzata . The Lucas Awards are given out by the Cuban Institute for Radio and Television , an institute of the Cuban government and so -- in U.S. terms -- can be compared to a mix between MTV 's programming and broadcasting influence on the one hand , and the cultural credentials and government recognition of the National Endowment for the Arts on the other .

Baghi Sipahi ( ) is a 1958 Indian Hindi-language film directed by Bhagwan Das Varma and starring Madhubala , Chandrashekhar and Ranjan . It is loosely based on the 1951 American film Quo Vadis , which in turn was adapted from the 1896 book with the same title by Henryk Sienkiewicz . Baghi Sipahi was released on 1 January 1958 .
Plot
Baghi Sipahi is set in Rome in Nero 's time , and has a theme based on Christians and their persecution by the Roman Empire .
The film tells the story of a Roman military commander ( Chandrashekhar ) , who , after returning from the war , falls in love with Ranjana ( Madhubala ) , a devout Christian . Ranjana is technically a hostage of the Roman Emperor ( Ranjan ) . However , as a reward for his services , the commander is able to persuade the Emperor to give Ranjana to him . Although Ranjana resents this arrangement , she eventually falls in love with the commander .
As the film progresses , the Emperor 's massacres of the Christians become progressively more despicable . When the kingdom catches fire , the Emperor blames the Christians at the suggestion of his wife ( Nishi ) . This in turn leads to more atrocities toward the Christians , instigating the commander to become a rebel soldier to protect Ranjana and the Christian community .
Much of the movie proceeds with the cruel spectacles that ensue with the increasingly irrational behavior of the Emperor . Ultimately , the commander succeeds in overturning the situation , leading to the demise of the Emperor with the assistance of a palace slave ( Purnima ) , who was once in unreciprocated love with the Emperor .
Cast
Madhubala as Ranjana
Chandrashekhar as the military commander
Ranjan as the Emperor
Nishi as the Emperor 's wife

Soundtrack
The soundtrack of Baghi Sipahi was composed by Shankar–Jaikishan .
Reception
A review by Thought disliked the fact that Madhubala was present in almost the whole film , but found her to be `` vivacious '' in her role . The sets and other actors were only formally praised . However , according to Thought , the lavish war scenes were great in visuals .

`` The Farmer and the Cowman '' is a song composed by Richard Rodgers and with lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II for their 1943 musical Oklahoma ! . It is sung primarily by Andrew Carnes , Aunt Eller , and Ike Skidmore . In various versions of Oklahoma ! , the singing parts for Ike , Andrew , and Aunt Eller have been swapped . Lines for Will Parker , Ado Annie , and Curly McLain are also included . Repetition of the refrain is sung by the entire company .
This song is included in the first scene of the second act of Oklahoma ! . It is accompanied by an elaborate dancing sequence . This number , and the scene itself , takes place at the Skidmore Ranch , where the box social follows after the song .
In contrast to the rest of the musical , `` The Farmer and the Cowman '' does not further the plot but does allow the audience to witness the tension between the farmers and the cowmen , a tension that comes from the farmers ' desire to protect their crops with fences while the cowmen prefer the freedom to move cattle over a wide open range . Carnes , Aunt Eller and Ike act as peacemakers and attempt to reconcile the two sides . The song appears to have no effect , and the two sides start fighting . Aunt Eller then shoots a gun in the air to stop the fighting , and conducts both groups – preaching peace with the lyrics of the song , but threatening violence .
At the end of the song , however , there is a resolution . Both sides agree to act hospitably toward each other after receiving a bit of advice from Aunt Eller :
`` I do n't say I 'm no better than anybody else ,
But I 'll be danged if I ai n't just as good ! ''
The song resolves a minor subplot , although the conflict between Jud and Curly ( a farmer and a cowman ) has yet to be resolved at that point .

Kennar Valley ( ) is a small valley , ice free except for a lobe of ice marginal to Taylor Glacier at the mouth , located west of Finger Mountain in the Quartermain Mountains of Victoria Land , Antarctica . The name appears to be first used on a 1961 New Zealand Lands and Survey Department map compiled from New Zealand field surveys , 1957–60 , and U.S. Navy aerial photographs of that period . It was possibly named after Thomas Kennar , Royal Navy , Petty Officer on the Discovery during the British National Antarctic Expedition , 1901–04 , led by R.F . Scott . In November 1903 , Kennar and William J. Weller accompanied Hartley T. Ferrar in the first geological reconnaissance of the Quartermain Mountains .

The House in the Horseshoe , also known as the Alston House , is a historic house in Glendon , North Carolina in Moore County , and a historic site managed by the North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources ' Historic Sites division . The home , built in 1772 by Philip Alston , was the site of a battle between loyalists under the command of David Fanning and patriot militiamen under Alston 's command on either July 29 or August 5 , 1781 ( the date being unclear in available records ) . The battle ended with Alston 's surrender to Fanning , in which Alston 's wife negotiated the terms with the loyalists .
In 1798 , the home was sold to Benjamin Williams , who would become Governor of North Carolina from 1799 to 1802 , and again in 1807–1808 . Williams owned approximately 103 slaves and produced about 300 acres of cotton annually at the site of the house .
The Moore County Historical Association purchased the home in 1954 , and ownership was then transferred to the state in 1955 . The property was made a North Carolina Historic Site in 1971 . It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970 . The property is now used as a museum and as the site of Revolutionary War reenactments and living history demonstrations each year .

Maekawa 's theorem is a theorem in the mathematics of paper folding named after Jun Maekawa . It relates to flat-foldable origami crease patterns and states that at every vertex , the numbers of valley and mountain folds always differ by two in either direction . The same result was also discovered by Jacques Justin and , even earlier , by S. Murata .
Parity and coloring
One consequence of Maekawa 's theorem is that the total number of folds at each vertex must be an even number . This implies ( via a form of planar graph duality between Eulerian graphs and bipartite graphs ) that , for any flat-foldable crease pattern , it is always possible to color the regions between the creases with two colors , such that each crease separates regions of differing colors . The same result can also be seen by considering which side of the sheet of paper is uppermost in each region of the folded shape .
Related results
Maekawa 's theorem does not completely characterize the flat-foldable vertices , because it only takes into account the numbers of folds of each type , and not their angles .
Kawasaki 's theorem gives a complementary condition on the angles between the folds at a vertex ( regardless of which folds are mountain folds and which are valley folds ) that is also necessary for a vertex to be flat-foldable .

John Kennedy ( May 14 , 1834 – September 28 , 1910 ) was born a British subject in Ireland , and became an American citizen and a private in the Union Army . He received the United States military 's highest decoration for bravery , the Medal of Honor , for his actions during the Battle of Trevilian Station in the American Civil War .
Biography
He was born May 14 , 1834 and at the Battle of Trevilian Station in Virginia on June 11 , 1864 , he and four other soldiers were assigned to a twelve-pound-capacity brass artillery piece under direct command of Lt. William Egan , as part of the battery commanded by Lt. Alexander Pennington , within Gen. George Armstrong Custer 's Michigan Cavalry Brigade . A squadron of cavalry led by Confederate Capt . Daniel A. Grimsley attacked their position , and a retreat was ordered . Kennedy and Pvt . Charles O'Neil remained at the cannon to cover the retreat of the rest of their unit , at some point becoming cut off from retreating themselves . They exhausted first their grape shot and canister shot , then their rifle and then pistol ammunition , finally being captured while continuing resistance with handspikes and sponge staffs . ( Their position and the cannon were shortly recaptured in a Union artillery and cavalry counter-attack . )
The captured privates were imprisoned at the Andersonville prison ; Kennedy survived , and served after the war in the Regular Army , advancing to the rank of ordnance sergeant and retiring in 1891 . He was nominated for the Medal of Honor in 1892 by Lt. Carle E. Woodruff , and this was endorsed by Pennington , at that point a major .
He died September 28 , 1910 and is buried in Oakland Cemetery Little Rock , Arkansas . His grave can be found in the Willow lot 298 .
Medal of Honor citation
His Medal of Honor citation in 1892 described his actions as
Remained at his gun , resisting with its implements the advancing cavalry , and thus secured the retreat of his detachment .

Ang mga Anak Dalita ( `` [ The ] Children of the Poor '' ) is a 1911 Tagalog-language novel written by Filipino novelist Patricio Mariano . The 73-page novel was published in Manila by Limbagan at Aklatan Ni I.R . Morales ( Printing Press And Library of I.R . Morales ) during the American era in Philippine history ( 1898–1946 ) . Ang mga Anak Dalita is a political novel that deals also with Filipino ideology , the socio-economic situation , the industrial upheaval , and the struggle of the oppressed Filipino working class in Manila during Mariano 's time .
Description
Mariano wrote Ang mga Anak Dalita in poetic form . The theme of the novel is about how the poor in the Philippines become poorer by being exploited by capitalists . According to literary critic Soledad Reyes , there was a scene in the novel wherein Ata , the main female protagonist , narrates a story about how the Philippines ( represented by the name `` Mutya '' , meaning `` pearl '' , `` precious stone '' , or `` charmstone '' ) became the victim of Spain ( represented by the name `` Dulong '' , a type of small fish known as the Gobiopterus lacustris ( lacustrine goby ) , which belongs to the family Gobiidae ) , and the United States ( represented by the name `` Limatik '' , meaning `` leech '' ) . Based on Philippine history , the Philippines was colonized by Spain from 1521 to 1898 , and then by the United States from 1898 to 1946 .
Plot
The characters of the novel include Ata , Teta , Pedro , and a factory owner . Ata is a poor woman . Teta is Ata 's daughter . Pedro is Ata 's lover . The factory owner in the novel is the “ avaricious ” and “ lustful '' boss of Ata . The factory owner tried to rape Ata , but she was able to escape . During a conflict with the laborers , Ata 's daughter Teta saves the factory owner from being killed by the factory workers . In the end , Teta turns out to be the daughter of the factory owner . The theme of the novel is similar to Mariano 's other novel Ang Tala sa Panghulo ( `` The Bright Star at Panghulo '' ) .

Holby City is a British medical drama television series that was broadcast on BBC One in the United Kingdom between 12 January 1999 and 29 March 2022 . The series was created by Tony McHale and Mal Young as a spin-off from the BBC medical drama Casualty , which is set in the emergency department of the fictional Holby City Hospital , based in the equally fictitious town of Holby . Young wanted to explore what happened to patients treated in Casualty once they were taken away to the hospital 's surgical wards . He opined that Casualty limited itself to `` accident of the week '' storylines , while Holby City allowed the possibility of storylines about long-term care , rather than immediate life-and-death decisions .
Holby City has earned various awards and nominations , with the nominations in categories ranging from Best Drama to its writing and editing work to the cast 's acting performance . It received nominations for eight awards from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts ( BAFTAs ) , winning the Best Continuing Drama in the 2008 British Academy Television Awards — an award for which it was unsuccessfully nominated in for three years prior to winning and five years after winning . Despite being the most shortlisted Holby City actress , Amanda Mealing ( who portrayed Connie Beauchamp ) did not win any awards for her role . Jimmy Akingbola was the most acclaimed actor from the series , winning two awards for his role as Antoine Malick . Rebecca Wojciechowski and Peter Mattessi are the only members of the show 's production team to win an accolade ; they have each won a Writers ' Guild of Great Britain award . The serial has also been nominated for 32 awards at the National Television Awards , although it has never won .

The Kreuzfelsen is a high rock outcrop , that forms the western cornerstone of the Kaitersberg mountain ridge in the Bavarian Forest in southern Germany . From the giant cross on its summit the view sweeps down into the Zeller Valley and over to the town of Bad Kötzting and also far over the western part of the Bavarian Forest .
Below the Kreuzfelsen is `` Highwayman Heigl 's Cave '' ( Räuber-Heigl's-Höhle ) , the hideout of a 19th-century robber . Numerous trails lead up to the summit cross , the most well-trodden being the E6 European long distance path which runs from Kötzting past the nearby Kötztinger Hütte cafe and the Riedlstein to the Großer Arber .
On the Kreuzfelsen there is an extensive range of worthwhile sport climbing routes , that are well-secured and can be negotiated using top roping .

Reception
Thomas Goonan , writing for Library Journal , rated the book `` [ r ] ecommended , '' praising its `` [ e ] xcellent illustrations '' that `` elucidate the text '' and `` [ g ] ood index . Comparing it to Edward Stoddard 's The Story of Power , he judged de Camp 's work `` [ m ] ore comprehensive and
detailed . ''
The Science News-Letter , in its September 23 , 1961 issue , listed the book among its `` Books of the Week , '' describing the work as a `` [ c ] olorful panorama depicting and describing man 's development of sources of energy to help him build , move around and produce . ''
The Booklist considered the subject `` effectively presented in well-written text and a multitude of supplementary [ illustrative materials ] , all captioned and most of them in color . Its review repeated Goonan 's judgment of the work as `` more comprehensive '' than Stoddard 's . In appraising the work for older children , The Booklist noted it was `` [ j ] uvenile in approach but may be useful in high schools , particularly for its illustrations .
Isaac Asimov , writing for The Horn Book Magazine , called it `` an exciting book written with great authority and illustrated lavishly , '' noting that `` [ f ] or young people interested in mechanics and machinery this book is a complete feast . '' He finds that `` [ t ] he human mind is the hero throughout , '' with `` [ t ] he personalities of scientists interest [ ing ] Mr. de Camp only as they affect the scientists as conveyors of new thoughts . ''
Claire Huchet Bishop in The Commonweal praised the book 's `` [ e ] xcellent approach which makes less of the machines than it does of the minds that created them . ''
Henry W. Hubbard in The New York Times wrote that `` Mr. de Camp has filled his book with accurate information and absorbing history , '' but noted that while `` [ t ] he writing is usually good , ... the first chapter , on manpower , suffers from jarring transitions , and the detailed explanations of steam engines and such are occasionally hard to follow . '' He finds the illustrations `` colorful and skillfully chosen . They are , in fact , the high point of the book . '' Summing up , he states that `` [ b ] y virtue of its thoroughness , and its informative illustrations , `` Man and Power '' should be especially useful in libraries and schools . ''

In the Army Now is the seventeenth studio album by the English rock band Status Quo , released on 29 August 1986 by Vertigo Records . Recorded at Chipping Norton Recording Studios in Oxfordshire and Jacobs Studios in Surrey , it was the first album with the post-Live Aid lineup , featuring bassist Rhino Edwards and drummer Jeff Rich , both of whom joined in March 1986 .
`` I was later told that nobody at the label was interested in a Quo featuring bassist Alan Lancaster and Rick Parfitt , '' recalled frontman Francis Rossi . `` They wanted Parfitt and me . I also learned that unless we did something together , we 'd have to pay back a shitload of money ... I was adamant that I would never work with Lancaster again , but he warned us that he would injunct us if we tried to do it without him . And when we won he went fucking bananas . ''
The album contains covers of `` In the Army Now '' , first recorded in 1982 by Dutch duo Rob and Ferdi Bolland , and `` Speechless '' , from ex-Mott the Hoople singer Ian Hunter 's 1983 album All of the Good Ones Are Taken .
`` The title song was great , '' Parfitt later observed of the album , `` but it had too many fillers . ''

Fort Duncan was a United States Army base , set up to protect the first U.S. settlement on the Rio Grande near the current town of Eagle Pass , Texas .
History
A line of seven army posts were established in 1848–49 after the Mexican War to protect the settlers of West Texas and included Fort Worth , Fort Graham , Fort Gates , Fort Croghan , Fort Martin Scott , Fort Lincoln and Fort Duncan . Fort Duncan was established on March 27 , 1849 , when Captain Sidney Burbank occupied the site with companies A , B , and F of the First United States Infantry . On November 14 , 1849 , the post was named Fort Duncan , after Col. James Duncan , a hero of the Mexican–American War .
The post consisted of a storehouse , two magazines , four officers ' quarters , and a stone hospital , in addition to quarters for enlisted men . Construction was done half by the troops and half by hired workers . There was ample stone but no timber for building , and the men suffered from exposure . Company C , 1st Regiment of Artillery , asked permission to construct quarters at its own expense . During the 1850s , Fort Duncan provided merchants and traders protection from border frontier outlaws and Native Americans . The fort also served as a post for scouting Native Americans .
In 1854 , Lt.s Philip Sheridan , Zenas Bliss , Richard W. Johnson and Assistant Surgeon Albert J. Myer were stationed here , the Lieutenants after graduating from West Point .
Fort Duncan became involved in an invasion of Mexico on 2 October 1855 , when Texas Ranger Captain James H. Callahan led an effort to capture `` runaway slaves '' , but confronted by Mexican regular troops , Seminoles and the ex-slaves , Callahan retreated to Piedras Negras , which caught fire , threatening his force with annihilation until Capt . Burbank covered Callahan 's retreat across the Rio Grande with Fort Duncan artillery .
Secretary of War John B. Floyd ordered the post abandoned in May 1859 , but Lt. Col. Robert E. Lee ordered the fort reoccupied in March 1860 during the Cortina Troubles . The fort at this time consisted of `` 25 buildings ... nearly all are stone and adobe with thatched roofs . ''
General David E. Twiggs ordered the fort evacuated on 21 February 1861 , just before the outbreak of the American Civil War . However , Major William H. French was able to evacuate three companies of artillery at Fort Duncan and two at Fort Brown to Fort Jefferson and Fort Zachary Taylor in Florida . The CSA garrisoned the fort with volunteers and Texas Rangers , renaming it Rio Grande Station , which became an important port for the export of cotton into Mexico .
Federal troops reoccupied Fort Duncan on 23 March 1868 by the 41st Infantry under the command of Lt. Col. William R. Shafter , and Lt. Henry Ware Lawton as quartermaster . An additional unit of Buffalo soldiers stationed at the fort , besides the 41st , was the 9th Cavalry . This included George B. Jackson , later a businessman in San Angelo called `` the wealthiest black man in Texas '' during the second half of the 19th century . The 25th Infantry arrived under the command of Major Bliss in 1870 , and the Black Seminole Scouts were organized at the fort , initially under the command of 2nd Lt. Henry Field Leggett , but later commanded by 2nd Lt. John L. Bullis .
The post was abandoned once again on 31 August 1883 .
Camp at Eagle Pass
Camp at Eagle Pass was established on 3 April 1886 as a sub-post of Fort Clark until it was discontinued in February 1927 . The 3rd Texas Volunteer Infantry was based here from 25 May 1898 until 16 February 1899 . The camp was ordered abandoned in 1904 but a detachment of Signal Corps was placed here on 9 February 1911 while `` Mexico was aflame with revolution '' until 1914 . The National Guard was mobilized here in 1916 , joining the Coast Artillery Corps , while the 90th Aero Squadron operated DH-4Bs from here in 1919 until 1920 , which included Jimmy Doolittle . Only a caretaker force remained to watch over the hospital from 1922 until final closure of the camp in 1927 .
Military Aviation
On 3 March 1911 , Benjamin Foulois and Philip Orin Parmelee flew the US military 's first cross-country reconnaissance flight here from Laredo using a Wright Model B covering 106 miles in two hours at an altitude of 800 feet .
Preservation
In 1933 , the City of Eagle Pass Parks and Recreation Department began maintaining the old fort as a public park . The city formally acquired the property in 1938 at an auction price of $ 3760 and converted it into Fort Duncan Park . In 1942 the mayor offered the fort to the military for use during World War II . The government used the Fort Duncan Country Club as an officers ' club and the swimming pool for commissioned personnel stationed at Eagle Pass Army Air Field . The site was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1971 . Seven of the original buildings still stand today . In the early 1980s , the Fort Duncan Country Club caught fire and only the outer walls remain .
The Commander 's Headquarters building has been converted into the Fort Duncan Museum , with exhibits of local and fort history and artifacts .

Ken'ichi Nomoto ( 野本 憲一 Nomoto Ken'ichi , born 1 December 1946 in Tokyo ) is a Japanese astrophysicist and astronomer , known for his research on stellar evolution , supernovae , and the origin of heavy elements .
Education and career
Nomoto graduated in astronomy from the University of Tokyo with a B.S . in 1969 and a Ph.D. in 1974 . As a postdoc he was a research fellow of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science . At Ibaraki University he was an assistant professor from 1976 to 1981 . At the University of Tokyo he became an assistant professor in 1982 , an associate professor in 1985 , and a full professor in 1993 . At the Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe ( IPMU ) he was a principal investigator from 2007 to 2017 , as well as a project professor from 2008 to 2017 , and is since 2017 a visiting senior scientist . He was a research associate at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center ] ] ( 979–1981 ) and has held visiting positions at several institutions , including Garching 's Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics ( 1982 and 1983 ) , the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign ( 1983 ) , Brookhaven National Laboratory ( 1985–1986 ) , the University of Amsterdam ( 1992 ) , and the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics . He is now the University of Tokyo 's Hamamatsu Professor in the endowed research unit , Dark Side of the Universe .
In 2008 he , with his colleagues Keiichi Maeda and Masaomi Tanaka , discovered by using the Subaru Telescope that most core-collapse supernovae are not spherically symmetric but instead elongated in shape . With Maeda and others , he reported that the spectral diversity in Type Ia supernovae ( SNe Ia ) is a consequence of random directions from which such asymmetric explosions are observed . Their empirical findings indicated that the spectral evolution diversity is not a serious concern in using SNe Ia as cosmological standard candles for determining distances . He was a member of an international team of astronomers that published in 2008 their study using the Subaru Telescope to observe `` light echoes '' in the remnant of Tycho 's Supernova ( SN 1572 ) ; such light echoes bounced off dust particle surrounding the remnant and reached Earth 436 years after Tycho Brahe 's observation in 1572 . The team compared their 2008 observed spectroscopic data with many other supernova spectra to show that Tycho 's Supernova is a statistically typical example of a Type Ia supernova . He was part of the research group that revealed that the exceptionally bright Type Ia supernova named SN 2009dc had a progenitor star with a mass ( 1.44 ) slightly above the Chandrasekhar limit due to its fast rotation . The discovery has implications for the common use of Type Ia supernovae as standard candles for measuring distances in the Universe . In 2010 , he and colleagues succeeded in detecting a supernova ( SN 2005cz ) , which is a core-collapse supernova with progenitor star at the low-mass end ( i.e. , 8 to 12 M⊙ ) of the range of massive stars that can produce supernovae . In 2012 he , with two colleagues , explained the fact that often no companion star was found in Type Ia supernovae . Their explanation is that , before the supernova explosion , the companion star of the binary star system evolved into a helium-rich white dwarf , which is difficult to observe . Their explanation solved a problem for the origin of Type I supernovae according to the single degenerate ( SD ) accretion scenario , in which a red giant or other main sequence star gradually loses mass by accretion onto the nearby white dwarf . In the competing double degenerate ( DD ) scenario , two white dwarfs with a high carbon-oxygen content merge .
Nomoto received in 1989 the Nishina Memorial Prize , in 1995 the Japan Academy Medal , and in 2010 a medal from the Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris . In 2015 he received the Marcel Grossmann Award for showing theoretically that binary systems produce various forms of stellar evolution and can produce `` various types of supernovae , hypernovae and gamma-ray bursts , as well as neutron stars and black holes . '' In 2019 he received the Hans A. Bethe Prize of the American Physical Society for `` lasting contributions to our understanding of the nuclear astrophysics of the universe , including stellar evolution , the synthesis of new elements , the theory of core-collapse and thermonuclear supernovae , and gamma-ray bursts . '' In 2020 he was awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasure .

Corsley is a hamlet and civil parish west of Warminster in Wiltshire , England . The parish is on the county border with Somerset ; the Somerset town of Frome is about to the northwest . The largest settlement in the parish is Corsley Heath , which is on the A362 Warminster-Frome road .
The parish has several small settlements . Lye 's Green is between Corsley and Corsley Heath ( not to be confused with Lye Green , in Westwood parish near Bradford on Avon ) . Lane End is west of Corsley Heath on the A362 , while the small hamlet of Sturford is to the east . South of the main road are Dertfords , Longhedge , Whitbourne Moor ( formerly Lower Whitbourne ) , Temple ( formerly Middle Whitbourne ) and Whitbourne Springs ( formerly Upper Whitbourne ) .
Much of the parish was originally part of the Longleat Estate and part of the Longleat Safari Park lies within the parish boundary . Cley Hill , owned by the National Trust , is in the east of the parish .
History
The Domesday Book says of Corsley `` Azor holds one hide in Corselie ... Here is ploughed land ... and the mill pays 40 pence . And the wood is a furlong in length and half a furlong broad . It is worth 20 shillings . '' In 1232 , Henry III granted the manor of Corsley to Godfrey de Crawcumb , with the right to hold an annual fair on 20 July ( the feast of St Margaret ) and a weekly market on Fridays .
By about 1250 , there were four separate manors , Corsley , Little Corsley , Huntenhull , and Whitbourne .
In 1544 , after the monastery at Maiden Bradley had been dissolved , the manor of Whitbourne was sold and the chapel of St John there disappeared . In 1579 , Little Corsley was bought by Walter Hungerford of Farleigh Hungerford Castle . In 1539 , the manor of Corsley was granted to Edward Seymour , who in 1547 leased it to his steward John Thynne . In 1560 Thynne was himself granted the manor of Corsley ; he built or rebuilt a house at Corsley , part of which survives as Manor Farm , and lived there from 1563 to 1568 while rebuilding Longleat House .
After the death of Thynne in 1580 , his widow , known as Dame Dorothy , lived at Manor Farm as a dower house . At the same time , Sir Walter Raleigh , who was in disgrace , was living at a farm near St Margaret 's parish church , Corsley . He and his brother Carew Raleigh used to visit Dame Dorothy , who married Carew Raleigh .
The boundaries of the civil parish were redrawn in 1934 . The northern part ( including Corsley Mill and Huntenhull ) was transferred to the new parish of Chapmanslade , while in the south a portion of Longleat 's park and woodland was transferred from Warminster to Corsley .
A National School was built at Corsley in 1847 on land owned by Lord Bath , near the church . Children of all ages attended until 1931 , when pupils over 11 transferred to the new Avenue Senior School at Warminster . In 1944 the school became a Church of England aided school ; it closed in 2007 owing to falling pupil numbers . The building became a conference centre , and was a temporary home for Frome 's Steiner School from 2012 to 2014 .
Churches and chapels
There are two Churches of England churches in the parish . Both are served by the Cley Hill team ministry .
The parish church of St Margaret , Corsley , was built in 1833 by John Leachman on the site of an earlier church .
St Mary 's Church at Temple was built as a chapel of ease in 1899–1903 , in Arts & Crafts Gothic style , after Mary Barton ( d. 1878 ) of Corsley House left money in her will to provide the church in memory of her husband and son . Around 2015 the church was taken into the care of the Friends of Friendless Churches .
Wesleyan Methodists were active from 1769 and a chapel was built at Lane End in 1849 , with a schoolroom added late in the century . The chapel closed in 1966 and is in residential use .
The parish had a Baptist congregation by the 1780s , and a chapel was built at Temple in 1811 . Money to pay for the land and the building was raised by the preacher , Richard Parsons of Chapmanslade , who continued as pastor until his death in 1853 . Around the middle of the century the chapel was enlarged , and its height increased ; the interior was refurbished in 1882 . As of 2016 the chapel remains in use as Whitbourne Baptist Chapel .
Notable buildings
Corsley House was built for the Barton family in 1814 , designed by the Bath architect John Pinch the elder as a Greek revival mansion around a previous house . Later residents include ( from the 1890s ) Maud Davies , whose Life in an English Village , published in 1909 , is a pioneering sociological study .
Sturford Mead was built in 1820 by John Pinch in the Greek revival style for H.A . Fussell , a clothier and dyer from Frome . It was sold to the Longleat estate in 1854 ; in the 1930s it was occupied by Henry Thynne , 6th Marquess of Bath , then Viscount Weymouth , and his first wife Daphne . The gardens were designed by Russell Page .
Local government and MP
Corsley elects a parish council . Most local government services are provided by Wiltshire Council , which has its offices in nearby Trowbridge . The village is represented in Parliament by the MP for South West Wiltshire , Andrew Murrison and in Wiltshire Council by Fleur de Rhé-Philipe .

`` Say 'uncle ' ! '' is a chiefly North American expression demanding that the opponent in a contest submit . The response `` Uncle ! '' is equivalent to `` I give up ! '' or similar sentiment , and indicates submission .
Definition
In the United States and Canada , the idiomatic expression `` Say 'uncle ' ! '' may be used as an imperative command to demand submission of one 's opponent , such as during an informal wrestling match or tickling . Similarly , the exclamation `` Uncle ! '' is an indication of submission—analogous to `` I give up ! `` —or it may be a cry for mercy , in such a game or match .
Origin
There are several theories on the phrase 's origin .
Due to heavy Irish immigration in eastern Canada and New England in the 19th century , it is likely an anglicization of the Irish 'anacal ' , meaning deliverance or quarter .
A less likely theory is that it derives from a phrase uttered by youngsters in the Roman empire who got into trouble , ( “ uncle , my best of uncles ” ) .
A fanciful suggestion is that it may be based on a joke from 19th-century England about a bullied parrot being coaxed to address his owner 's uncle .
Another suggested origin is from the English phrase “ time out ” , a plea to cease hostilities . The abbreviated usage `` T.O . '' was mistaken for the Spanish “ tío ” , which means `` uncle '' .
Foreign-language analog
There is a common analog in the Arabian Peninsula , the expression `` '' ( [ q ] uwl 'aamiy ) , which means `` say uncle '' .

Thomas Rossell Potter ( 7 January 1799 – 19 April 1873 ) was a British antiquary . He started a school in Leicestershire , but he is known for his publications about the history and geology of Leicestershire . He was the editor of a number of local newspapers .
Biography
Born at West Hallam , Derbyshire to John and Mary Potter , he went to Risley grammar school , and later to the grammar school at Wirksworth . When he was fifteen his parents removed to Wymeswold in Leicestershire , and there he resided until his death .
Potter 's intention of entering the church was frustrated by his father 's death , and Potter accordingly started a school on Elm Street in Wymeswold called `` The Hermitage '' ( pictured ) . The school proved successful , and , with the exception of a few years devoted entirely to literary work , he spent the remainder of his days in tuition . The account below is taken from a schoolbook by Thomas Wamer Lacey which was rediscovered in a record office in 1999 . He wrote :
`` ... I then came to Mr Potters of Wymeswould , he is a very kind master , and Mrs Potter is a kind mistress , and was like a mother to us all , and will always be remembered by us . Mr Potter takes us a fishing , and bathing , and we have delightful walks , a pleasant playground , pretty little gardens , rabbithouses , & c. furnish amusements for us in the Summer evenings . In Winter we have a Library of Books to run to , a magic lantern to amuse us , and many a long hour do we spend in listening to Mr P~s tales round the cheerful fire ... ''
A notable student of his was the antiquarian John Joseph Briggs .
Potter had developed a taste for literature , and especially for antiquities and geology . In 1841/42 he temporarily removed from Wymeswold to a house in Charnwood Forest , and while there he collected notes about the history , antiquities , natural history , and geology of the area . This became The History and Antiquities of Charnwood Forest .
Potter attempted a reissue of the History of Leicestershire by John Nichols , but his effort proved abortive , and , though much was written , only the Physical Geography and Geology of Leicestershire was printed ( in 1866 ) .
Potter was fond of field sports , was a regular attender at meets of the Quorn Hunt , and contributed a series of papers and poems for the Sporting Magazine from 1827 until 1840 , under the pseudonym of Old Grey . He afterwards wrote for the Sporting Review . He became editor of the Leicester Advertiser in 1849 , of the Ilkeston Pioneer in 1856 , and of the Leicester Guardian in 1858 . In 1865 he was editor of the Loughborough Monitor ( later the Loughborough Monitor and News ) .
Potter married , on 14 January 1836 , Frances Sarah Fosbrooke of Shardlow Hall , Derbyshire . They had five sons and four daughters . Potter predeceased his wife , dying in Wymeswold .
Besides the works mentioned , he published :
Walks round Loughborough , 1840 .
The Genius of Nottinghamshire , 1849 .
Rambles round Loughborough , reprinted from The Loughborough News , 1868 .
Poems , 1881

Guy Rollingsheim Brewer ( January 27 , 1904 – October 31 , 1978 , aged 74 ) was an American politician who served in the New York State Assembly between 1969 and 1978 . He was one of the first African-Americans to be elected to political office in the New York City borough of Queens , and the first African-American to serve as Majority Whip in the Assembly . His district in southeastern Queens included the community of Jamaica , where a major thoroughfare , New York Boulevard was renamed Guy R. Brewer Boulevard after his death .
Early life
Guy Brewer was born in Georgia . By the 1930s he was a real estate broker in the neighborhood of Washington Heights in Manhattan , where he was also a Democratic Party leader . He clashed with the Tammany Hall politicians who dominated Manhattan politics at the time when they diverted money from his district to a predominantly white one , making him a political pariah by his own account .
In 1941 , he joined a large number of African-Americans who were moving to Jamaica and vicinity at the time . As a real estate agent , he sought to help create a suburban African-American community in the area . He again got involved in Democratic politics , joining other activists who sought to increase African-American participation in local politics in an era when all of Queens ' elected officials were white . In 1964 Kenneth Brown won a race to represent Jamaica in the State Assembly , becoming the first African-American elected government official in Queens . In 1968 , Brewer was elected to succeed Brown , who had become a judge .
Tenure in New York State Assembly
In the Assembly , Brewer championed several local issues . He opposed one proposal by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to build an quarantine facility for sick animals in St. Albans , Queens , and another to construct an industrial facility on the site of Springfield Park in Springfield Gardens . Neither of these were built . He was in favor of capital punishment , was pro-choice , and advocated a policy of open admissions at the City University of New York . He was a critic of government welfare policies that he viewed as accelerating urban decay in the area .
Late in his tenure , after he became afflicted with prostate cancer , Brewer advocated for the legalization of the controversial drug laetrile , which proponents claim to have anti-cancer properties but which mainstream medicine views as a toxic substance without health benefits . Due in part to his efforts , a bill that would make it legal to market the substance in New York passed the state legislature , but it was vetoed by Gov . Hugh Carey . Brewer and other supporters in the legislature were unable to garner enough support to override the veto and the bill never became law . He died of cancer shortly thereafter on Oct. 31 , 1978 , and his cremated remains were interred in a Queens mausoleum .
Personality and legacy
Brewer was known for his sarcastic wit , eloquence , and debating skill . He was married to Marie Brown Brewer ( c. 1906 - 1984 ) , who was also a Democratic district leader in Manhattan and was the first African-American woman to be an elected district leader in Queens , New York . The couple lived in the East Elmhurst section of Queens . In 1982 , New York Boulevard , which runs from downtown Jamaica 3.7 miles south to the northern edge of JFK Airport , was renamed Guy R. Brewer Boulevard in his honor .

Xlejli Tower ( formerly spelt Shilejli Tower , or Torri Xulliela ) , also known as Bettina Tower , is a tower in Gudja , Malta . It was probably built as a watchtower since it has views over a large area of land . The age of the tower is not known , and it could date back to the Roman or medieval periods , or possibly a later reconstruction . The tower is now located in the grounds of Palazzo Dorell , and it is closed to the public .
History
Its date of construction is not known , but it might have Roman origins . According to , the historian of the Order of St. John , an urn full of Roman copper medals was found at the tower . The tower also has a round shape , similar to other Punic-Roman towers in Malta . It is believed that the remains of an old and round building are those of a watchtower . The Xlejli Tower was built in the parametres of these remains in an architectural style to appear as a ‘ ruined ' tower .
The oldest reference to the tower dates back to 1570 , when it was described as a lookout tower built in the 12th or 13th century . The tower was almost definitely built as a watchtower , since it has views of the southern part of Malta , stretching from Bengħisa to the Grand Harbour .
In the 17th century , the Palazzo Dorell was built close to the tower , and the latter was included in its grounds within a large walled garden . Since then , the tower has been closed for the public . The palace was the property of Marquees Bettina Testaferrata Dorell , and she restored the tower and decorated its interior . Due to this , it also became known as Bettina Tower after her . She had actually named it as Xlejli , which has a literal meaning of `` tacked together '' in old Maltese .
Some sources suggest that though the foundations of the old tower were retained on site , the present tower was built within the remains around 1780 .
In World War II , a bomb fell close to the tower , destroying a statue . The bomb also destroyed an entire orchard . The tower is built of Maltese limestone and purposely used shiny pieces of glass , with an appearance of a ruined tower ( hence the name ) .

András Rogan was a 17th-century Slovene Catholic priest in Hungary , in Dokležovje .
It is likely that he was born in the upper Slovene March ( Prekmurje , Goričko ) . The surname Rogan is frequent near the municipalities of Rogašovci , Martinje , and Tišina . He likely studied in Zagreb and Varaždin .
He was the priest of Dokležovje . In 1676 , he compiled a manuscript of sermons , mostly transcriptions from the Kajkavian dialect ( with some Prekmurje Slovene words ) . The sermons originate from Anton Vramec 's Postila from 1586 . The Catholic Hungarian Slovenes in the 16th through 18th centuries used the Kajkavian form of Croatian .

20th-century Indian biographers
Madagascar ( 1994 ) is a Cuban film that marked Fernando Pérez 's change of direction into a more lyrical approach to filmmaking , somehow stripped from the realistic documentary feel of his early work . The film chronicles the relationship and lack of communication between a mother and daughter during the Cuban economic crisis known as the Special Period .
Background and plot synopsis
Madagascar was originally conceived as the first part of a trilogy to be entitled 'Pronóstico del tiempo ' ( `` Weather Prediction '' ) . The production and post-production of director Fernando Pérez 's third fiction film was completed in September 1993 to await the preparation of the work 's other two parts : 'Melodrama ' ( `` Melodrama , '' dir . Rolando Díaz ) and 'Quiéreme y verás ' ( `` Love me and you 'll see , '' dir . Daniel Díaz Torres ) . The three directors had worked together to develop their ideas for the creation of the project , but in the end , according to Pérez , the films wound up lacking the necessary continuity necessary to bind them together . Partly as a result of such concerns over their contents , and partly in response to the delays produced by an ongoing shortage of production funds for Díaz 's and Díaz Torres ' works , each wound up being released independently . During December 1994 , over one year after the completion of its post-production , Madagascar first appeared in Cuba 's theatres as part of the annual New Latin American Film Festival held in Havana .
Madagascar was inspired by the 1984 Mirta Yáñez short story `` Beatles contra Duran Duran '' ( `` Beatles Against Duran Duran '' ) . The story chronicles the relationship between the narrator , who is a single mother and pragmatic middle-aged professor of physics , and her moody adolescent daughter . The plot of the film draws loosely from the original text , which Pérez appears to have used as a point of departure and a rough character sketch as he worked closely with cinematographer Raúl Pérez Ureta and screenwriter Manuel Antonio Rodríguez during the developmental stages of the project . Laura ( played by Zaida Castellanos ) and Laurita ( played by Laura de la Uz ) are the central characters of the film and bear an obvious resemblance to the unnamed narrator of the short story and her daughter , Pilar . However , the film 's mode of expression as well as its plot both diverge greatly from that of the story .
The main characters ' opposing personalities form the focal points of the film 's narrative , which becomes a sort of psychological travelogue . During the opening sequence , we learn that Laura 's life has entered into a mysterious psychological crisis , exacerbated by her daughter 's extreme behavior . In an opening monologue , she tells us that she has lost the ability to dream anything different from what she experiences in her daily life . This monologue , and ostensibly the rest of Laura 's ongoing voice-over narration , occurs in the context of a consultation with an unseen doctor . From then on , the plot focuses around Laura 's internal conflicts and her relationship with her daughter . In an early scene , Laurita informs her mother that she has grown tired of school and will be taking a break from her studies in order to travel to Madagascar . In response , Laura becomes furious and criticizes Laurita for indulging in such frivolous fantasies . Increasingly disaffected , Laurita proceeds to undergo a series of personality transformations . This disturbs Laura , who is frustrated with the stagnant conditions of her own life , but can not make such sudden changes .
Laura and Laurita live together with Laura 's elderly mother ( Elena Bolaños ) , and are accompanied by a reticent young painter known only as Molina ( Jorge Molina ) who appears to have befriended Laurita . Throughout the film , the family moves often , changing homes four times . The film has the episodic quality of a road movie as much of the exposition thus takes place in the midst of the family 's relocations . The climax occurs when , following a particularly difficult argument with her mother , Laurita decides to run away from home . She returns after a few days , but the experience has altered both her and her mother . In the final scene , the two have practically traded personalities , and it is Laura who tells her daughter , `` nos vamos de viaje para Madagascar '' ( `` we 're going to travel to Madagascar '' ) .
The creators of the film bore the circumstances of its production admirably well . Prior to the collapse of the Soviet Union , ICAIC had imported all of its film and development chemicals from the USSR and its economic allies . The lack of chemicals on the island after 1991 forced Madagascar 's production unit to mail all of their negatives to a lab in Venezuela , making `` dailies , '' or the practice of reviewing each day 's shooting and then re-filming whatever did not turn out as planned , impossible . Despite being forced to `` shoot blind , '' as it were , Pérez maintains that he and his crew did not lack any truly fundamental supplies ( besides gasoline , which was in scarce supply throughout the island by mid-1993 ) . Nevertheless , the director did believe at the time that it would be his last film and such conditions may have played a significant role in the development of the film 's style and plot .
To date , Madagascar and the other pieces intended to make up `` Pronóstico del tiempo '' remain some of the last films to receive all of their production funds exclusively from el Instituto Cubano de Arte e Industria Cinematográficos ( ICAIC , the `` Cuban Institute for the Film Art and Industry '' ) . During the early 1990s , the Cuban economy had fallen on hard times and ICAIC 's budget suffered accordingly . By 1995 , the small , semi-autonomous , national industry that had been producing independent works since 1959 had to restructure itself to meet the demands of the international market . Co-productions with outside organizations , intended for release in foreign markets became the only available means of survival .

Thor-Agena was a series of orbital launch vehicles . The launch vehicles used the Douglas-built Thor first stage and the Lockheed-built Agena second stages . They are thus cousins of the more-famous Thor-Deltas , which founded the Delta rocket family . The first attempted launch of a Thor-Agena was in January 1959 . The first successful launch was on 28 February 1959 , launching Discoverer 1 . It was the first two-stage launch vehicle to place a satellite into orbit .
Missions
Among other uses , the clandestine CORONA program used Thor-Agena from June 1959 until January 1968 to launch United States military reconnaissance satellites operated by the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) . During this program , Thor-Agena launch vehicles were used in 145 launch attempts , now known to have been part of satellite surveillance programs .
Also , Alouette 1 , Canada 's first satellite , was launched on a Thor-Agena B .
1963 Mystery Cloud
On 28 February 1963 , a Thor-Agena launch vehicle carrying a spy satellite into orbit was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base . The launch vehicle went off course and mission control detonated the launch vehicle at an altitude of before it could reach orbit . The launch vehicle detonation produced a large circular cloud that appeared over the southwestern United States . Due to its mysterious nature , appearing at a very high altitude and being visible for hundreds of miles , the cloud attracted widespread attention and was published by the news media . The cloud was featured on the cover of Science Magazine in April 1963 , Weatherwise Magazine in May 1963 , and had a full page image published in the May issue of Life Magazine . Prof. James MacDonald at the University of Arizona Institute for Atmospheric Physics investigated the phenomena and linked it to the Thor launch vehicle launch after contacting military personnel at Vandenberg Air Force Base . When the launch records were later declassified , the United States Air Force released a memo explaining that the cloud was the result of a military operation .

Union County is a county located on the central southern border of the U.S. state of Arkansas . As of the 2010 census , the population was 41,639 . The county seat is El Dorado . The county was formed on November 2 , 1829 , and named in recognition of the citizens ' petition for a new county , which said that they were petitioning `` in the spirit of Union and Unity . '' The county is directly adjacent to the south to Union Parish in the state of Louisiana .
The El Dorado , AR Micropolitan Statistical Area includes all of Union County .
Called by boosters the `` Queen City of South Arkansas '' , El Dorado was at the heart of the 1920s oil boom in South Arkansas . More recently , the city has been called `` Arkansas 's Original Boomtown , '' as it emphasizes its historic assets for heritage tourism . The chemical and timber industries became important during and after World War II , and still have a place in the economy .
History
Union County was formed on November 2 , 1829 , from portions of Clark and Hempstead counties . Areas along the waterways were originally developed for cotton plantations in the antebellum years , and planters depended on large groups of enslaved African-American workers to generate their profits .
On January 10 , 1921 , Dr. Samuel T. Busey hit oil with a well about a mile south of El Dorado , leading to an oil boom that attracted thousands of workers and speculators . His first well produced for fewer than two months , but by 1923 , `` El Dorado boasted fifty-nine oil contracting companies , thirteen oil distributors and refiners , and twenty-two oil production companies . The city was flooded with so many people that no bed space was available for them , leading to whole neighborhoods of tents and hastily constructed shacks to be erected throughout the city . The city 's population reached a high of nearly 30,000 in 1925 during the boom before dropping to 16,241 by 1930 and rising to 25,000 by 1960 . '' Oil production fell markedly in the early 1930s , in part due to companies ' financial difficulties during the Great Depression . It recovered later in the decade .
During World War II , chemical plants were established in the county , but their production declined after the war . Exploitation of Arkansas forests led to growth in the timber industry in the county . Oil , chemical and timber industries are still important to the economy , although in lesser proportion .
Geography
According to the U.S. Census Bureau , the county has a total area of , of which is land and ( 1.5 % ) is water . It is the largest county by area in Arkansas . Union County , along with Columbia County , has the largest bromine reserve in the United States . The lowest point in the state of Arkansas is located on the Ouachita River in Union County and Ashley County , where it flows out of Arkansas and into Louisiana .

Dom Afonso I of Braganza ( ; 10 August 1377 – 15 December 1461 ) was the first duke of Braganza and the eighth count of Barcelos . He founded the House of Braganza , the most powerful and wealthy dynasty in Portugal . His descendants became high-ranking nobles , imperial officials , and finally kings of Portugal and emperors of Brazil .
Early life
Historians believe he was born in Veiros , Estremoz , Alentejo , as a natural son of Portuguese King John I and Inês Peres . He married the heiress Beatriz Pereira de Alvim , daughter of Nuno Álvares Pereira , a general and the wealthiest man in the kingdom .
A traveled and cultivated man , Afonso was present in 1415 when the Portuguese conquered Ceuta .
Royal succession
When his half-brother , King Duarte I of Portugal , died in 1438 , his son Afonso V ( Afonso 's nephew ) was an infant and the choice of regent was his sister-in-law , the Queen Mother Eleonor of Aragon . This choice was not popular because Eleonor was Aragonese . Among the aristocracy , however — especially Afonso 's inner circle — , Eleonor of Aragon was preferred . There were also doubts about Peter 's political ability . At a meeting of the Portuguese Cortes summoned by Afonso 's half-brother John , Lord of Reguengos de Monsaraz , the regency was awarded to the Infante Peter , Duke of Coimbra , another half-brother of Afonso and an uncle of the young king . This choice pleased both the people and the fast-growing bourgeoisie .
In 1443 , in a gesture of reconciliation , Peter made Afonso the first Duke of Braganza . But , in 1445 , Afonso took offence because Isabella of Coimbra , Peter 's daughter , became the choice for Afonso V 's wife , and not one of his granddaughters . Indifferent to the intrigues , Peter continued his regency and the country prospered under his rule . It was during this period that the first subsidies for the exploration of the Atlantic Ocean were appropriated under the supervision of Henry the Navigator ( another of Afonso 's half-brothers ) .
On 9 June 1448 , King Afonso V came of age , and Peter turned over control of the country to the king . An ambitious man , Afonso persuaded his nephew , the young king , to turn against Peter . Influenced by Afonso , the king nullified all of Peter 's edicts .
The following year , under accusations that years later would prove false , Afonso V declared his uncle Peter a rebel . The situation became unsustainable and a civil war began . On 20 May 1449 , during the Battle of Alfarrobeira , near Alverca , Peter was killed .
After the Battle of Alfarrobeira , Afonso V gave new powers to his uncle Afonso and nine years later when he departed for Africa , the regency was delegated to him .
Marriages and issue
Afonso married twice . His first marriage was to Beatriz Pereira de Alvim , on 8 November 1400 , with whom he had three children :
Afonso married a second time , to his first cousin once removed , Constance of Noronha , daughter of Alfonso Enríquez , Count of Gijón and Noreña ( a natural son of Henry II of Castile ) , and of Isabel of Portugal ( a natural daughter of Fernando I of Portugal ) . They had no issue .

William Morris ( 1834-1898 ) , a founder of the British Arts and Crafts movement , sought to restore the prestige and methods of hand-made crafts , including textiles , in opposition to the 19th century tendency toward factory-produced textiles . With this goal in mind , he created his own workshop and designed dozens of patterns for hand-produced woven and printed cloth , upholstery , and other textiles .
Embroidered textiles
The first textile designs Morris made were created in the 1860s and were for embroideries , expressing his interest in medieval arts and crafts , particularly the medieval wall hangings that he admired as a child . In a collection of essays by members of the Arts and Crafts movement published in 1893 , he wrote that one of the aims of embroidery should be simply `` The exhibition of beautiful material . Furthermore , it is not worth doing unless it is either very copious and rich , or very delicate - or both . ''
His first embroidery designs were primitive , but later , working with his wife Jane , he created a set of wall hangings for his residence in the London suburbs , Red House . One of his designs in this historical style , stitched by Jane Morris , won the Morris company an award in an international competition in 1862 . Morris and his workshop began making embroideries for the households of his friends as well as larger panels for some of the many new churches being constructed in England . In these designs , Morris created the decorative elements , while his friend Edward Burne-Jones drew the figures , and a team of embroiderers manufactured the work by hand . Other wall hangings were designed to be sold off the shelf of the new Morris and Company shop on Oxford Street which owned in 1877 . Later , he and his daughter May made designs for panels for `` embroider yourself '' kits for cushion covers , fireplace screens , doorway curtains , bedcovers and other household objects . In 1885 , Morris turned production of embroidery entirely over to his daughter .
Furnishing textiles and woven fabrics
In the late 1860s Morris began to experiment with a genre , textiles for furnishing or upholstery . His first design was jasmine trail or jasmine trellis ( 1868–70 ) , based on a similar wallpaper design he had made in 1862 . In the 1870s , he expanded his activity in woven furnishing textiles . IN 1877 , he brought a skilled French silk weaver , Jacques Bazin , from Lyon to London , rented a studio at Great Esmond Yard , and established Bazin and his mechanical Jacquard loom there to make woven wooden fabrics .
In 1881 , he opened new workshops at Merton Abbey , seven miles southwest of London , for manufacturing printed and woven textiles . The workshops were next to the River Wandle , providing a source of abundant clean water , and also had a grassy meadow where dyed clothes could be dried in the open air . He produced a number of furnishing fabrics there , including the Wey and Wandle designs .
Printed textiles
Morris made his first experiments with printed textiles for his company Morris , Marshall , Faulkner and Co. beginning in 1868 , at about the same time he was starting to make printed wallpaper ( see William Morris wallpaper designs ) . These first textiles were recreations of earlier designs he had made from the 1830s , and were printed for Morris by the workshop of Thomas Clarkson of Bannister Hall , in Lancaster . His next textile was Trellis with jasmine ( 1868–70 ) . This was printed with synthetic analine dyes . Next he made Tulip and Willow , a design he made in 1873 , but he was very disappointed by the result . He blamed the problem on the artificial dyes , and began doing research into the natural dyes which had been used in the 16th century .
The Strawberry Thief became one of Morris 's best-known designs . It depicted a scene from his own garden , where thrushes came to dine upon the ripe strawberries .
Morris moved with his family to Turham Green in 1872 , which created greater space in his house at Queen Square in London where Morris had his workshop . Morris and his assistant John Smith made a series of experiments with indigo and other natural dyes , but were unable to attain colours that satisfied Morris . In 1875 , Morris tried working with a commercial printer , Wardle and Company , using wood blocks with a reduced number of colours and modern chemical dyes , This time he was dissatisfied with the lack of quality control by the workers , and the uneven results . He therefore decided to establish his own workshop , where he could control everything .
He moved his printing workshop to Merton Abbey Mills , near the Merton Abbey Priory . For printed textiles , the design was traced onto a block of pear wood , and then the wood was sculpted so only the desired surface would touch the fabric . Thin strips of brass were pounded edge-first into the block to make the fine lines . One block was used for each colour of the final fabric , The block was inked by placing into a vat of colorant , and then carefully placed onto the fabric on the table in front of the craftsman . He pounded it with a mallet to impress the colour , then he lifted the block carefully , moved the fabric , re-inked the block , and printed the next section with the same colour . When the first colour was finished , the finished fabric was set aside to dry . If more than one colour was used , once the fabric was dry , a block with the next colour would be inked and carefully impressed over the image left by the first . The same process and the same blocks could be used for making both fabrics and wallpaper . Since fifteen or more colours might be used , It was an extremely laborious and long process , sometimes lasting several weeks , and the cost was higher than that of mechanical printing methods .
Tapestries
Morris wrote that making tapestries was 'the noblest of all the weaving arts ' , and most suitable for his interest in reviving medieval arts and crafts . He set up his first tapestry loom in 1877 , and made completed his first tapestry , was 'Acanthus and Vine ' in ( 1879 ) . He wove the tapestry himself , often getting up at dawn to work on a loom in his bedroom at Kelmscott House . His design was modelled after the `` large leaf '' tapestries woven in France and Flanders in the 16th century , and he deliberately gave them a faded appearance to make them look two centuries old . He recorded that it took him five hundred sixteen and one half hours to complete .
Once he had mastered the technique , he created a full-time tapestry workshop at the Morris and Company house on Queen Square . For most of his tapestries , Morris worked with other artists , particularly Edward Burne-Jones , who designed the figures , Philip Webb , who designed birds and animals , and with his primary assistant and successor as chief designer , John Henry Dearle . Burne-Jones made a drawing of the figures first , which was transformed into a color design by Morris or Dearle . A photographic image was made of he designs with figures , to which Morris or Dearle added a floral background , and a border equally filled with designs of trees and flowers . The full scale image was transferred onto cloth by rubbing with a piece of ivory , and then woven on a loom . Large-scale tapestries were made in this way at Merton , mostly by the employment of boys ages thirteen and fourteen , who received shelter , board and a daily wage .
The most famous tapestries made by Burne-Jones and Morris were Holy Grail tapestries made for William Knox D'Arcy in 1890 for his dining room at Stanmore Hall Additional versions of the tapestries with minor variations were woven on commission by Morris & Co. over the next decade .
In addition to full-scale tapestries , the Merton Abbey workshop produced smaller works , designed as coverings for cushions and furniture . Multiple copies were made of some popular tapestries . Ten copies were made of The Adoration between 1890 and 1907 .
Carpets
In March , 1875 , Morris became the sole owner of what became William Morris Company , buying out the shares of his partners . He decided to diversify the products by adding carpets , a market that was almost totally dominated by original or imitation oriental carpets . Within three months , he had registered his first design for the Cataline floor cloth , a decorative covering for linoleum floors , a material which had been invented in 1855 . By December had registered two designs for machine-woven carpets which he had made by the Wilton Royal Carpet Factory .
As usual , Morris set a high goal for himself . His aim , he declared , was to make England independent of the Orient for the provision of hand-make carpets which aspire to the status of art . He made a careful study of techniques and materials , and made a series of experiments . When he moved to Kelmscott House in 1879 he began to produce a series of carpets called Hammersmith . He hired a labor force of young women to work on looms he set up in the former stables and garage of his London residence . He also revived the art of hand-knotting for making small carpets .
In the 1880s , in addition to the Hammersmith carpets , Morris created series of designs for machine-made Axminster and Kidderminister carpets , made at the Wilton factory or at Heckmondwike Manufacturing company in Yorkshire . Many of the carpets he designed used the patterns he had invented for printed fabrics , but others , particularly the Hammersmith carpets , resembled the designs he made for his woven textiles . His early carpets sometimes borrowed popular oriental motifs . The designs he made for Axminister and Wilton carpets were less lavish in their ornament and more geometrical , to make them more affordable .
In 1881 he moved the workshop to Merton Abbey , where there was space to weave much larger carpets commissioned by his clients . His designs for these large Hammersmith carpets moved farther away from the Oriental influence , and took on a more specifically English style . As with his wallpapers other textiles , his inspirations were most often flowers , plants and animals found in English gardens .
One particularly notable design was the Bullerswood carpet , was made in 1889 for the wool trader John Sanderson , who had a country residence called Bullerswood in Chislehurst , Kent . Morris made two versions of the carpet for the house , in collaboration with his assistant John Henry Dearle . Extremely complex , they were virtual anthologies of all of the motifs of Morris . Morris made one carpet for the living room and another for the front hallway . He also strictly supervised the decoration of these rooms , so it would be in harmony with the carpet .
The William Morris style
Morris explained his ideas about textile designs in a group of essays by members of the Arts and Crafts movement published in 1893 . In his essay on textiles , Morris wrote : `` The aim should be to combine clearness of form and firmness of structure with the mystery which comes of abundance and richness of detail ... Do not introduce any lines or objects which can not be explained by the structure of the pattern ; it is just this logical sequence of form , this growth which looks as if , under the circumstances , it could not have been otherwise , which prevents he eyes wearying of he repetition of the pattern .
`` ... Do not be afraid of large patterns ; if properly designed they are more restful to the eye than small ones ... Very small rooms , as well as very large ones , look best ornamented with large patterns . ''
`` ... As final maxims , never forget the material you are working with , and try always to use it for doing what it can do best : if you feel yourself hampered by the material in which you are working , instead of being helped by it , you have so far not learned your business , any more than a would-be poet has , who complains of the hardship of writing in measure and rhyme . ''
In the same group of 1893 essays , he expressed his views of tapestry designs . He wrote : `` As in all wall decoration , the first thing to be considered in designing of Tapestry is the force , purity and elegance of the silhouette of the objects represented , and nothing vague or indeterminate is admissible . But special excellencies can be expected from it . Depth of tone , richness of colour , and exquisite gradation of tints are easily to be obtained in Tapestry ; and it also demands that crispness and abundance of beautiful detail which was the especial characteristic of fully developed Medieval Art . The style of even the best period of the Renaissance is wholly unfit for Tapestry ; accordingly , we find that Tapestry retained its Gothic character longer than any other of the pictorial arts . ''
In writing about textiles , Morris emphasised the importance of using natural dyes and colours . `` These colours in fading still remain beautiful , '' he wrote , `` and even after long wear , never pass into nothingness , through that stage which of livid ugliness which distinguishes the commercial dyes as nuisances , even more than their short and by no means merry life . ''
As to colours for carpets , he wrote in his essay on textiles ; `` The soft gradations of tint to which Tapestry lends itself are unfit for Carpet-weaving ; beauty and variety of colour must be obtained bh harmonious juxtaposition of tints , bounded by judiciously chosen outlines , and the pattern should lie absolutely flat on the ground . On the whole , in designing carpets the method of contrast should is the best one to employ , and blue and red , quit frankly used , with white or very light outlines on a dark ground , and black or some very dark colour on a light ground , are the main colours on which the designer should depend . ''
Legacy
William Morris died on October 3 , 1896 , but the Morris & Co. continued to design and produce textiles he had designed or planned , under the supervision of his chief assistant and Art Director John Henry Dearle . Dearle managed the company 's textile works at Merton Abbey until his own death in 1932 . The firm was finally dissolved in 1940 , but his designs continue to be produced and marketed by other textile firms , including Sanderson and Sons , part of the Walker Greenbank wallpaper and fabrics business , which now owns the . `` Morris and Co. '' brand name , and by the department store Liberty of London .

Damesellidae is a family of odontopleurid trilobites found in late Middle to Late Cambrian marine strata , primarily of China . Damesellids are closely related to the odontopleurids of Odontopleuridae , but are not nearly as spinose , nor possess spines as exaggerated as Odontopleuridae . Like Odontopleuridae odontopleurids , damesellids have broad , bar-shaped cranidia with ledge-like borders . Damesellidae may represent transitional forms between more primitive , possibly ancestral ptychopariids and more advanced odontopleurids .

`` A Hazy Shade of Winter '' is a song by American music duo Simon & Garfunkel , released on October 22 , 1966 , initially as a stand-alone single , but subsequently included on the duo 's fourth studio album , Bookends ( 1968 ) . It peaked at number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 .
In 1987 , the Bangles recorded a cover version for the soundtrack of the film Less than Zero , which peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 . In 2019 , Gerard Way and Ray Toro recorded a cover version for the Netflix Original series The Umbrella Academy .
Background
The duo recorded `` A Hazy Shade of Winter '' during the sessions for Parsley , Sage , Rosemary and Thyme ( 1966 ) , but the song was not included on an album until 1968 's Bookends .
Composition
`` A Hazy Shade of Winter '' follows a more rock-tinged sound , with a fairly straightforward verse-refrain structure . The song dates back to Simon 's days in England in 1965 ; it follows a hopeless poet , with `` manuscripts of unpublished rhyme '' , unsure of his achievements in life .
The lyrics recall the transition from fall to winter , as suggested by the repetition of the final chorus of the song :
I look around , leaves are brownAnd the skyis a hazy shade of winterLook around , leaves are brownThere 's a patch of snow on the ground .
Author and disc jockey Pete Fornatale considered the lyrics evocative of , and standing in contrast with , those of John Phillips ' `` California Dreamin ' '' .
Reception
Billboard described the song as a `` winning number '' and a `` change of tempo for the duo [ which ] could make this their biggest to date . '' Cash Box said that it is a `` strong session bound for biggiesburg . '' Decades later , Allmusic critic Richie Unterberger described the song as `` one of [ Simon and Garfunkel 's ] the best songs , and certainly one of the toughest and more rock-oriented . ''

The Bangles version
In 1987 , the Bangles were approached to record a song for the soundtrack of the film Less than Zero . They chose to record a cover of `` A Hazy Shade of Winter '' , which they had been performing live since at least as far back as March 1983 .
Their cover , retitled `` Hazy Shade of Winter '' , was a harder-edged rock song that removed most of the bridge section . The record , like the rest of the soundtrack album , was produced by Rick Rubin . After a fruitful but disappointing experience with David Kahne , the producer of their album Different Light ( where they were given little input in the production of the songs ) , the group decided to take more control for the recording of this song , and they were given an additional producer credit . Michael Steele later commented that `` we sounded the most on this record the way we actually sound live '' , and `` If we had n't been so messed up as a band , it could have been a turning point for us . ''
Lead vocals were performed jointly by all four members of the group , with a short solo led by Susanna Hoffs towards the end . This was a rare occurrence in The Bangles songs , as they mostly had just one member singing lead . Due to pressure from their record label , The Bangles removed the verse from the original song that contained the line `` drinking my vodka and lime '' . According to liner notes on the soundtrack album , Steve Bartek from the band Oingo Boingo played acoustic guitar on the track .
When released as a single in November 1987 , `` Hazy Shade of Winter '' became a huge hit , surpassing the popularity of the original version , peaking at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 , behind Tiffany 's `` Could 've Been '' , and also number 11 in the UK . It was also a hit around Europe .
The music video ( the first for future country music video director Jim Shea ) showed the group singing in a studio surrounded by television screens on the walls , similar to a scene from the film Less than Zero , from which other scenes appear throughout the video .
`` Hazy Shade of Winter '' was not included on any of the group 's studio albums , but later appeared on their first official Greatest Hits in 1990 , and on many of their subsequent compilations . The accompanying video compilation for Greatest Hits did not include the promo for `` Hazy Shade of Winter '' , due to complications with the licensing of the movie rights of the scenes from Less than Zero that appear within the video clip .
The song appears during season 1 , episode 2 of the Netflix series Stranger Things , episode 9 of The Assassination of Gianni Versace : American Crime Story , season 6 , episode 9 of the Netflix series Lucifer , and season 1 , episode 1 of ( as well as promotional trailers for ) the Amazon Prime Video series Paper Girls .

Tanguy Alban Harrys Ngombo , often incorrectly written as Targuy Ngombo ( born July 18 , 1984 [ disputed ] ) , is a Congolese–Qatari professional basketball player who plays for Al Rayyan of the Qatari Basketball League . He has represented the Qatari national team in international competition . He was drafted by the Dallas Mavericks with the 57th pick in the 2011 NBA Draft . His draft rights were subsequently traded to the Portland Trail Blazers and then to the Minnesota Timberwolves . He is the first Qatari national basketball player to be selected in the NBA Draft .
Career
Ngombo has played in Qatar since 2006 after playing for the Inter Club Brazzaville in his home nation of the Congo . In 2011 , he helped Al Rayyan win the Qatar Basketball League . He led his team in scoring and rebounds , averaging 20.7 points and 8.9 rebounds per game . He then helped Al-Rayyan finish third in the FIBA Asia Champions Cup while averaging 16.3 points per game .
Ngombo has represented the Qatari national team since 2010 . He played in the 2010 FIBA Asia Stanković Cup , helping Qatar win the bronze medal . He played in all 7 games and led the team in scoring in every game with an average of 30.0 points per game . He then played for Qatar in the 2010 Asian Games in Guangzhou , China . He played in all 8 games , averaging 19.6 points per game as Qatar finished in 5th place .
On June 23 , 2011 , he was drafted by the Dallas Mavericks with the 57th pick in the second round of the 2011 NBA Draft . His draft rights were immediately traded to the Portland Trail Blazers as part of a three-team trade with the Denver Nuggets . The Blazers then traded his rights to the Minnesota Timberwolves in exchange for a future second-round pick . His rights were ultimately removed by Minnesota a month after general manager David Kahn was fired and replaced by Flip Saunders .
Age discrepancy
In 2005 , Ngombo , who was still playing with Congolese team Inter Club Brazzaville , was listed as being born on July 18 , 1984 in the 2005 FIBA Africa Clubs Champions Cup . A few years later , he was listed as being born in 1989 by FIBA Asia in the 2010 FIBA Asia Champions Cup , the 2010 FIBA Asia Stanković Cup and the 2010 Asian Games . However , in 2011 , FIBA published a piece of contradictory information by listing 1984 as Ngombo 's birth year on the Qatar roster for the 2011 FIBA Asia Championship .
At the 2011 NBA Draft , he was selected as Targuy Ngombo , who was a soon-to-be 22 year old player born in 1989 . After the draft , reports surfaced claiming that Ngombo lied about his name and his birth date and that he was actually born in 1984 , which would have made him ineligible for the draft . The NBA rules state that an international player who is over the age of 22 is not eligible for the draft and must be signed as a free agent . Additionally , the use of the name Targuy was a misspelling ; he was often listed under that name in several FIBA competitions . His trade to the Timberwolves , which was first reported on the night of the draft , was reportedly being held up for several days because of the age discrepancy . Four days after the draft , the Blazers announced that they had finalized the trade of Ngombo to the Timberwolves , which implies that the NBA approved Ngombo 's eligibility for the draft and the subsequent trades .

The National Democratic Labour Action Society – Wa'ad ( ) is Bahrain 's largest leftist political party .
History and profile
It emerged from the Popular Front , a `` radical '' clandestine opposition movement of socialist and Arab nationalist orientation . Under the reform process initiated by Bahrain 's King Hamad , the leaders of the Popular Front returned from exile to participate in the political process through the National Democratic Labour Action ( NDLA ) .
The party 's origins lie in the split within the Left in the Arab world in the 1960s , between a pro-Moscow camp and a pro-China camp , with the NDLA 's leaders backing Beijing . The party is the first licensed political group in any of the Arab states of the Persian Gulf .
Historically , the Left in Bahrain had been very strong , partly as a result of the creation of a local working class through the Kingdom 's industrialisation with the discovery of oil in the 1930s ; however the waning of Arab nationalism , the collapse of communism as an ideology and the rise of the Islamist Right have marginalised the NDLA and robbed it of much of its traditional support . The party was established by returning exiles in 2002 .
The current leader of the party is Fouad Seyadi , who was elected after the general assembly of the party in November 2016 . One of the current known figures of the party is Ibrahim Sharif Al-Sayed , who took over in 2005 until 2012 from Abdul-Rahman Al Nuaimi . In 2005 the party renamed itself Wa'ad ( ) , which translates to `` Promise '' . Other prominent members include : Abdul-Nabi Alekri , Ebrahim KamalAldeen , Sami Seyadi , Ali Salih and Munira Fakhro
The party suffered a very disappointing result in 2002 's municipal elections when none of its candidates were elected in any constituency . Despite this , the NDLA 's leaders are widely respected and retain a great deal of influence in Bahraini society . The party boycotted 2002 's parliamentary elections , but took part in the Bahraini parliamentary election of 2006 ; among its candidates was its vice president and former Harvard academic , Munira Fakhro , who contested an Isa Town constituency against Salah Ali of Al-Menbar Islamic Society .
In June 2017 , the party was banned on terrorism charges . The ban was criticised by Amnesty International and Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy . Lynn Maalouf of Amnesty International stated that `` the suspension of Waad is a flagrant attack on freedom of expression and association '' .
Organizational structure
The Highest Authority of Wa'ad is its General Assembly which all Wa'ad active members has the right to attend , which hold its meetings every 2 years . The General Assembly elects a Central Committee which holds the legislative power until the next General assembly . The Central Committee elects in its first meeting a General Secretary and a political bureau which act as governing body for the party until the next General Assembly .

Pit brow women or pit brow lasses were female surface labourers at British collieries . They worked at the coal screens on the pit bank ( or brow ) at the shaft top until the 1960s . Their job was to pick stones from the coal after it was hauled to the surface . More women were employed in this capacity on the Lancashire Coalfield than in any other area .
Background
In the early coal industry women and girls worked underground alongside men and boys in small coal pits . It was common practice in Lancashire and Cumberland , Yorkshire , the East of Scotland and South Wales . The death of Elizabeth Higginson working underground was recorded in the register of Wigan Parish Church in 1641 . An article in the Gentleman 's Magazine in 1795 described Betty Hodson aged nine who worked underground with her brother , aged seven , dragging baskets of coals for their father .
From the 1600s in Lancashire it was common for whole families to be employed in the pits . Colliers relied on their wives , sons and daughters who were employed as drawers . The daughters of colliers usually married within the mining community . As the industry grew the population expanded and more members of extended mining families obtained work . Pitwork in south-west Lancashire resulted in the area around Wigan having the highest rates of female employment in the country in the 19th century .
On 4 July 1838 , a flash flood at the Huskar Pit near Silkstone in Yorkshire caused the deaths of 26 children aged from seven to 17 who were drowned while trying to escape . The disaster led to a public outcry and subsequent Royal Commission led by Anthony Ashley Cooper . Until the Mines and Collieries Act 1842 was passed prohibiting boys under ten years of age and all women and girls from working underground in coal mines , it was common for women and children to work shifts of 11 or 12 hours underground . Children as young as five or six worked as trappers opening and closing ventilation doors before becoming hurriers , pushing tubs of coal to the shaft bottom .
After the 1842 Act
The prohibition of underground female labour caused much suffering and hardship and was greatly resented in south-west Lancashire . The employment of women did not end abruptly in 1842 ; with the connivance of some employers , women dressed as men continued to work underground for several years . Penalties for employing women were small and inspectors were few and some women were so desperate for work they willingly worked illegally for less pay . Children continued working underground at some pits . At Coppull Colliery 's Burgh Pit , three females died after an explosion in November 1846 ; one was eleven years old .
Not all women who had worked underground gained employment as surface workers . Lighter work on the surface had traditionally been reserved for older men and men who had been injured below ground and some colliery owners considered pits unsuitable places for women . Other colliery owners were happy to employ women who had proved themselves reliable and strong workers and were used to the language and habits of the miners . Male surface workers earned twice the wages of the women who worked twelve-hour shifts , five days a week and a shorter shift on Saturdays . Women surface workers were concentrated in Scotland , South Wales , Cumberland , Shropshire and South Staffordshire and Lancashire .
Dress
Pit-brow women working outside in the cold and dirt developed a distinctive `` uniform '' , they wore clogs , trousers covered with a skirt and apron , old flannel jackets or shawls and headscarfs to protect their hair from coal dust .
The women 's unconventional but practical dress drew them to the attention of the public and carte de visite and cabinet card portraits and later postcards of them in working clothes were produced commercially and sold to visitors as novelties . Photographic studios in Wigan which produced such work were Louisa Millard ( in the late-1860s ) , Cooper ( between 1853 and 1892 ) , and Wragg ( which produced a series of at least 18 studio images ) . Arthur Munby , a lawyer with an interest in women who worked in dirty and unusual conditions , commissioned many photographs . Munby visited the Wigan area many times over many years , interviewing working-class women and recording in his diaries what they had to say about their jobs , pay and living conditions .
Victorian sensibilities were outraged by women working at pits and dressing in trousers was considered unfeminine and degenerate by society .

Y Gorddwr had remained under the control of the Corbet family ( barons of Caus ) and therefore the English king .
The cantref of Ystlyg ( excluding Y Gorddwr ) corresponds to the later hundred of Deuddwr .

In filmmaking , a wipe is a type of film transition where one shot replaces another by travelling from one side of the frame to another or with a special shape . If the wipe proceeds from two opposite edges of the screen toward the center or vice versa , it is known as a barn door wipe ( named for its similarity to a pair of doors opening or closing ) .
The following are some specific styles of wipes :
An iris slow is a wipe that takes the shape of a growing or shrinking circle . It has been frequently used in animated short films , such as those in the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoon series , to signify the end of a story . When used in this manner , the iris wipe may be centered on a certain focal point and may be used as a device for a `` parting shot '' joke , a fourth wall-breaching wink by a character , or other purposes . Optional graphic ( i.e . rips ) occasionally overlay it to achieve a certain effect like an iris tearing transition .
A star wipe is a wipe that takes the shape of a growing or shrinking star and is used to impart a sense of `` extra specialness '' or `` added value '' . An example of the `` star wipe '' can be seen in the Guiding Light opening sequences of the 1980s . This convention was considered overused during that time period and is now generally thought to be somewhat out-of-date . The use was parodied in Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters and The Simpsons .
A heart wipe is a wipe that takes the shape of a growing or shrinking heart , and is used to impart a sense of `` love '' or `` friendship '' . The heart wipe is still used in wedding , graduation , and bar mitzvah videos , among others , as it has now passed from stylistic into the realm of standard convention , though many people consider it tacky .
A matrix wipe is a patterned transition between two images . The matrix wipe can be various patterns such as a grid , stars , etc .
A clock wipe is a wipe that sweeps a radius around the center point of the frame to reveal the subsequent shot , like the sweeping hands of an analog clock . Because of this similarity , it is often used to indicate that time has passed between the previous shot and the next shot . One of the TV shows that used the effect is Regular Show . The Red Green Show also makes frequent use of this wipe style , featuring an animated roll of duct tape , and accompanied by the loud `` yanking tape off a roll '' sound effect .
The most common uses of the wipe effect is the invisible wipe where a camera follows a person into another room by tracking parallel to the actor . As the wall passes in front of the camera , the editor has the option of using a wipe to be able to choose any other matching take of the same scene . It is also commonly used in quick camera pans in action sequences , to make a cut invisible . Such wipes can be impossible to see in the finished film . A good example of this wipe can be seen in the movie Das Boot when director Wolfgang Petersen uses it to pan between two occupied U-boat pens , even though they had only one U-boat for filming .
Some extremely effective ( and expensive ) wipes were used in the otherwise very low-budget Laurel and Hardy short film Thicker than Water . For each of the scene changes in this film , either Laurel or Hardy or both of them would seize a curtain or some other object at the edge of the frame and move it across the screen . The opening frames of the next scene were optically printed onto this object , so that—when the object entirely filled the screen—the movie had `` wiped '' the last shot of the previous scene and begun the first shot of the next .
The earliest known example of a wipe was George Albert Smith 's film Mary Jane 's Mishap of 1903 .
George Lucas made sweeping use of wipes in his Star Wars films , inspired by a similar use of wipes by Akira Kurosawa .
Since at least the 1980s , the American game show The Price is Right has made extensive use of wipes , usually from contestants to prizes . In the early-to-mid 1980s , an iris slow was used twice during the opening sequence , transitioning from the shot of the host entrance to the camera panning down from the studio lights , and then from that camera shot to one of the host . Around 1987 , this was changed to a star wipe , which the show would end up using for years until 2010 .

Nautilus is the fictional submarine belonging to Captain Nemo featured in Jules Verne 's novels Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea ( 1870 ) and The Mysterious Island ( 1874 ) . Verne named the Nautilus after Robert Fulton 's real-life submarine Nautilus ( 1800 ) . For the design of the Nautilus Verne was inspired by the French Navy submarine Plongeur , a model of which he had seen at the 1867 Exposition Universelle , three years before writing his novel .
Description
Nautilus is described by Verne as `` a masterpiece containing masterpieces '' . It is designed and commanded by Captain Nemo . Electricity provided by sodium/mercury batteries ( with the sodium provided by extraction from seawater ) is the craft 's primary power source for propulsion and other services . The energy needed to extract the sodium is provided by coal mined from the sea floor .
Nautilus is double-hulled , and is further separated into water-tight compartments . Its top speed is . In Captain Nemo 's own words :
Nautilus uses floodable tanks in order to adjust buoyancy and so control its depth . The pumps that evacuate these tanks of water are so powerful that they produce large jets of water when the vessel emerges rapidly from the surface of the water . This leads many early observers of Nautilus to believe that the vessel is some species of marine mammal , or perhaps a sea monster not yet known to science . To submerge deeply in a short time , Nautilus uses a technique called `` hydroplaning '' , in which the vessel dives down at a steep angle .
Nautilus supports a crew that gathers food from the sea . Nautilus includes a galley for preparing these foods , which includes a machine that makes drinking water from seawater through distillation . Nautilus is not able to refresh its air supply , so Captain Nemo designed it to do this by surfacing and exchanging stale air for fresh , much like a whale . Nautilus is capable of extended voyages without refueling or otherwise restocking supplies . Its maximum dive time is around five days .
Much of the ship is decorated to standards of luxury that are unequalled in a seagoing vessel of the time . These include a library containing about twelve thousand books , with boxed collections of valuable oceanic specimens . The library is also filled with expensive paintings and other works of art . Nautilus also features a lavish dining room and even an organ that Captain Nemo uses to entertain himself in the evening . By comparison , Nemo 's personal quarters are very sparsely furnished , but do feature duplicates of the bridge instruments , so that the captain can keep track of the vessel without being present on the bridge . These amenities however , are only available to Nemo , Professor Aronnax , and his companions .
From her attacks on ships , using a ramming prow to puncture target vessels below the waterline , the world thinks it a sea monster , but later identifies it as an underwater vessel capable of great destructive power , after Abraham Lincoln is attacked and Ned Land strikes the metallic surface of Nautilus with his harpoon .
Its parts are built to order by companies including Creusot and Cail & Co. in France , Pen & Co. and Laird 's in England , Scott 's in Scotland , Krupp in Prussia , the Motala workshops in Sweden , and Hart Bros. in the United States . Then they are assembled by Nemo 's men on a desert island . Nautilus returned to this island , where Nemo later helped castaways in the novel The Mysterious Island . After Nemo dies on board , the volcanic island erupts , entombing the Captain and Nautilus for eternity .
Claimed Links between the Confederate warship CSS Alabama and the Nautilus
In 1998 the Jules Verne scholar William Butcher was the first to identify a possible link between the Birkenhead built Confederate commerce raider CSS Alabama and Captain Nemo 's Nautilus . Butcher stated The Alabama , which claimed to have sunk 75 merchantmen , was destroyed by the Unionist Kearsarge off Cherbourg on 11th June 1864… . This battle has clear connections with Nemo 's final attack , also in the English Channel .
Jules Verne had himself made a previous comparison between the Birkenhead built CSS Alabama and the Nautilus in a letter to his publisher Jules Hetzel in March 1869 .
In September 2021 the Birkenhead born geography teacher John Lamb noted that both the hull of the fictional Nautilus and the hull of the real-life Confederate warship CSS Alabama had both been built in secret at the Laird 's shipyard in Birkenhead , lying opposite the port of Liverpool . Furthermore , both vessels had been finished on a ‘ desert island ' - in the case of the Alabama on the Azores Island of Terceira
In Jules Verne 's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas ( 1869 ) Captain Nemo explains how he built the Nautilus… Each of its components , Dr Arronax , was sent to me from a different point on the globe via a forwarding address . … . the iron plates for its hull by Laird 's of Liverpool… . I set up my workshops on a small desert island in the middle of the ocean . There with my workmen , that is my good companions whom I instructed and trained , I completed our Nautilus .
According to the historian Stephen Fox , Captain Raphael Semmes had portraits of General Robert E Lee and the Confederate President Jefferson Davis on the cabin wall of the CSS Alabama . In Jules Verne 's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas , Captain Nemo has portraits of Abraham Lincoln and the radical abolitionist John Brown adorning the cabin walls of the Nautilus . Raphael Semmes was a supporter of slavery while Captain Nemo is a militant antislaver .
The two-year voyage of the CSS Alabama had covered a distance of approximately 75,000 miles which equates to just over 21,700 leagues and Jules Verne may have chosen Captain Nemo 's motto of ‘ Mobilis in Mobile ' quite simply because the captain of the CSS Alabama – Raphael Semmes , was a resident of Mobile , Alabama .
In 1869 Captain Raphael Semmes released his American Civil War memoirs entitled Memoirs of Service Afloat During the War Between the States . In the same year of 1869 , Jules Verne released his classic novel Twenty Thousand leagues Under the Seas John Lamb catalogued the many similarities between the two books on his website Jules Verne and the Heroes of Birkenhead in August 2022 .
John Lamb hypothesized that to Jules Verne the CSS Alabama and Captain Nemo 's Nautilus might essentially be one and the same and that the militant abolitionist Captain Nemo is the ‘ alter ego ' of the pro slavery Raphael Semmes - i.e . the ‘ opposite of oneself ' https : //julesverneandtheheroesofbirkenhead.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/25.-Revealing-Captain-Nemo-Jules-Verne-in-Conversation-with-Raphael-Semmes.-2.pdf
In August 2022 the British Member of Parliament for Birkenhead , Mick Whitley , supported John Lamb 's further claims that Robert Louis Stevenson had set his classic novel Treasure Island in the towns of Birkenhead and Wallasey on the Wirral Peninsula lying opposite Liverpool . This followed a previous announcement by Alan Evans of Wirral Borough Council that Jules Verne had also set his 1874 novel The Mysterious Island in Birkenhead , so marking the return home of the Birkenhead built Nautilus . Their Letters of support for Mr Lamb 's claims were posted on the Jules Verne and the Heroes of Birkenhead website in August 2022 .
Notable appearances
Beside their original appearances in Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea and The Mysterious Island , Nautilus and Captain Nemo have appeared in numerous other works .
In the 1954 film adaptation of the first novel and in The Return of Captain Nemo , it is suggested that Nautilus is powered by nuclear energy ( discovered by Nemo himself ) , and that Nemo uses the same energy to destroy Vulcania , Nautilus 's base island .
In the 1969 film Captain Nemo and the Underwater City , Nautilus and its sister ship Nautilus II are depicted as industrialised stingray-like vessels , flattened with pronounced tumblehomes supporting rounded deckhouses . Each has a heavy girderwork tail , at the tip of which twin rudders and diving planes are mounted .
In Kevin J. Anderson 's Captain Nemo : The Fantastic History of a Dark Genius , Nautilus appears as a real submarine , apparently cigar-shaped like the one from the novel , built by Nemo for the Ottoman Empire .
In Stephen Norrington 's `` The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen '' , `` Nautilus '' appears as a real submarine that is white with silver embroidery .
Other Verne submarines
Submarines feature in some other of Verne 's works . In the 1896 novel Facing the Flag , the pirate Ker Karraje uses an unnamed submarine that acts both as a tug to his schooner Ebba and for ramming and destroying ships which are the targets of his piracy . The same book also features HMS Sword , a small Royal Navy experimental submarine which is sunk after a valiant but unequal struggle with the pirate submarine . In the book The Master of the World , Robur 's secondary vehicle , Terror , is a strange flying machine with submarine , automobile and speedboat capabilities . It briefly eludes naval forces on the Great Lakes by diving .

Martin O . May ( April 18 , 1922 – April 21 , 1945 ) was a United States Army soldier and a recipient of the United States military 's highest decoration—the Medal of Honor—for his actions in World War II .
Biography
Born and raised in Phillipsburg , New Jersey , May graduated from Phillipsburg High School in the class of 1941 .
May joined the Army from Phillipsburg in November 1942 , and by April 19 , 1945 , was serving as a private first class in the 307th Infantry Regiment , 77th Infantry Division . On that day and the next two days , at legusuku-Yama on Ie Shima in the Ryukyu Islands during the Battle of Okinawa , he manned his machine gun despite intense Japanese fire . He repeatedly refused to withdraw , even after being seriously wounded , and held his ground until being killed . For these actions , he was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor on January 25 , 1946 .
May , aged 23 at his death , was buried at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu , Hawaii .
Medal of Honor citation
Private First Class May 's official Medal of Honor citation reads :
He gallantly maintained a 3-day stand in the face of terrible odds when American troops fought for possession of the rugged slopes of legusuku-Yama on Ie Shima , Ryukyu Islands . After placing his heavy machinegun in an advantageous yet vulnerable position on a ridge to support riflemen , he became the target of fierce mortar and small arms fire from counterattacking Japanese . He repulsed this assault by sweeping the enemy with accurate bursts while explosions and ricocheting bullets threw blinding dust and dirt about him . He broke up a second counterattack by hurling grenades into the midst of the enemy forces , and then refused to withdraw , volunteering to maintain his post and cover the movement of American riflemen as they reorganized to meet any further hostile action . The major effort of the enemy did not develop until the morning of 21 April . It found Pfc . May still supporting the rifle company in the face of devastating rifle , machinegun , and mortar fire . While many of the friendly troops about him became casualties , he continued to fire his machinegun until he was severely wounded and his gun rendered useless by the burst of a mortar shell . Refusing to withdraw from the violent action , he blasted fanatical Japanese troops with hand grenades until wounded again , this time mortally . By his intrepidity and the extreme tenacity with which he held firm until death against overwhelming forces , Pfc . May killed at least 16 Japanese , was largely responsible for maintaining the American lines , and inspired his comrades to efforts which later resulted in complete victory and seizure of the mountain stronghold .

Call change ringing is a branch of the art of change ringing , in which a group of English-style full-circle bell ringers are instructed continually to create different sequences , or changes , of the bells ' striking order . Each command from the leader or `` conductor '' of the ringing results in a new sequence of sounding the bells . Each sequence is repeated until the next command or `` call '' .
The technique was probably developed in the early 17th century in the early days of change ringing .
Call change ringing requires one ringer to give commands to change the order of the bells , as distinct from method ringing , where the ringers memorise the course of bells as part of a continuous pattern .
Instructions
Calls are usually of the form `` X to ( or after ) Y '' or `` X Y '' ; in which X and Y refer to two of the bells by their physical numbers in the tower ( not by their positions in the row ) . All cause two bells to swap . The first form is used for calling up and calling down , and the second form swaps the two bells mentioned .
Use
Call changes are a valuable step in the learning process for aspirant method ringers . They are normally the next step after learning to control a bell and accurately ring it in `` rounds '' . Call changes are valuable in teaching bell-handling skills , such as the ability to judge the distance to be left over other bells ( this is different according to the size of the bell being followed ) and to move bells from one place to another in a row . Apart from their training role , call changes are widely rung by choice , or where there are not enough method ringers present in a tower .
Devon call-change ringing
Call changes are also rung as a form of change ringing in their own right , principally in parts of Devon and Cornwall .
The Devon Association of Ringers represents call change church bell ringers in Devon and was founded in 1925 . The association has 160 affiliated towers and arranges training events , social events and ringing festivals . The call change tradition emphasises rhythmic ringing in simple musical sequences , and there are many noted compositions .
The following is the most well-known call change peal on six bells . It is the test piece for Devon Association call-change competitions , together with raising and lowering in peal before and after . The calling strategy , or plan is shown below . This means the conductor does not have to memorise the 60-plus calls , but only the overall plan .
`` Sixty on thirds '' .
Call the bells to Queens . ( 135246 )
Call the treble up to 5ths place .
Call the third into 2nds place .
Call the treble down to lead .
Call the third into 4ths place .
Continue this process until the third is in 5ths place .
Call the fifth , then the second , then the fourth out to 5ths place in the same way , moving them one place when the treble is either leading or in 5ths place .
Queens is regained after 60 calls .

Christianity and neopaganism overlap when the beliefs or practices of one religious path influence , or are adopted by , the other . Historically , Christianity sometimes took advantage of traditional pagan beliefs when it spread to new areas – a process known as inculturation . Thus newly established churches took on sites , practices or images belonging to indigenous belief systems as a way of making the new faith more acceptable .
More recently , in a parallel process , some followers of modern pagan paths have developed practices such as Christopaganism by blending Christian elements into neopagan practice .
Historical syncretism
Christianity and classical paganism had an uneasy relationship with each being at different times persecutor or persecuted . However each also influenced the other . For example , a 10th–11th-century manuscript in the British Library known as the Lacnunga describes a charm against poison said to have been invented by Christ while on the cross , which has parallels in Anglo-Saxon magic .
Modern syncretism
In the modern era , examples of syncretism may include Christians seeking to incorporate concepts of the Divine Feminine from neopaganism into Christianity or Neopagans seeking to incorporate figures such as Jesus or Mary into Wiccan worship .
Christopaganism
Joyce and River Higginbotham define Christopaganism as : `` A spirituality that combines beliefs and practices of Christianity with beliefs and practices of Paganism , or that observes them in parallel . '' They give examples of people identifying as Pagan but observing both Pagan and Christian liturgical years , using the Rosary or observing a form of Communion .

Donald Melville ( 1829 – 20 March 1919 ) was a Scottish-born Australian politician .

Samuel Ashley Brown ( December 19 , 1923 – June 24 , 2011 ) was a professor emeritus at the University of South Carolina who taught English and comparative literature . While he founded the literary magazine Shenandoah , his fame rests in great part on the fact that he was a confidant of two famous American women writers : the novelist Flannery O'Connor and the poet Elizabeth Bishop . Much was learned posthumously about both women when their respective correspondence with Brown was made public .
Brown was born and raised in Louisville . Ashley Brown attended Louisville Male High School and went on to complete a master 's degree at Yale and a Ph.D. at Vanderbilt . It was while teaching at Washington and Lee University that he helped to found Shenandoah—a publication that featured the debut work of Tom Wolfe among others . He also taught at the University of Brazil and the University of California at Santa Barbara , before assuming the position at USC where he taught for 37 years . In 2007 , his collected manuscripts and correspondence were purchased by Emory University .
Ashley Brown died from natural causes on June 24 , 2011 , after spending the last year of his life in Still Hopes Episcopal Retirement Community .

In Manichaeism , Jesus ( Romanization of Parthian and Pahlavi : ) is considered one of the four prophets of the faith , along with Zoroaster , Gautama Buddha and Mani . He is also a `` guiding deity '' who greets the light bodies of the righteous after their deliverance .
Before the introduction of Manichaeism to Central Asia , the number of prophets recognized by it was undetermined . After being introduced to Central Asia , it was determined to be five , that is , the above-mentioned four prophets plus the Hindu god Narayana , because Hinduism had significant influence in ancient Central Asia .
Mani , the founder of the church , grew up in a Christian family in the 3rd century AD . His father Pātik was a believer in the church . They lived in southern Mesopotamia under the rule of the Sasanian Dynasty . Although Mani mentions Zoroastrianism and Sakyamuni in his own writings , Jesus is the key point . For example : `` Jesus is Mani 's savior '' ; `` Mani , the apostle of Jesus Christ '' ( Mani 's crystal seal and his own name in the letter ) ; `` Mani is the Holy Spirit of Jesus '' ( Mani 's disciples ' honorific title to him ) . Catholic Church Father Augustine once wrote about the Manichaeans ' obsession with Jesus and there are many hymns in the Manichaean scriptures in various languages .
Jesus and Mani
Mani was exposed to various forms of Christianity in southern Mesopotamia in the third century , and Jesus formed an important component in his teachings . Mani grew up in a Judeo-Christian community of the Elcesaites and had contact with other Christian groups , such as the Bardesanists and Marcionists . In this western region of the Sassanid Empire , Zoroastrianism was significantly less dominant than in the central provinces . The cosmopolitan and multi-ethnic environment of late ancient Mesopotamia allowed the well-educated Mani to consider the teachings of other prophets in relation to his own . While also Zoroaster and the historical Buddha were commented upon , Jesus received the most attention in Mani 's writings . Mani 's ties to Jesus are divided into three main themes : `` Jesus as Mani 's personal savior '' ( as seen in the Cologne Manichaean Codex ( en ) ) , `` Mani as the Apostle of Jesus Christ '' ( as seen in the Mani 's crystal seal and as a self-designation in his letters ) , and `` Mani as the paraclete of Jesus '' ( as seen in the designations of his disciples ) . In a sermon preserved in a Coptic translation from 4th century Egypt , Mani summarizes the life of Jesus .
Various sources confirm that themes of Christian origin , especially the figure of Jesus , continue to be significant throughout Manichean history . Augustine 's writings document the Manichean devotion to Jesus . Manichean hymns to Jesus are preserved in a variety of languages , especially Coptic from 4th century Egypt and , to a lesser extent , Parthian , Sogdian , Middle Persian , and Uighur , from Karakhoja in the 8th to 11th centuries , and even Middle Chinese , 8th century North China . This wealth of Jesus themes , especially in the western part of the Manichaean world , led to a Christian reading of Manichaeism that dominated early studies of this religion . Today , opinions on the origin of Manichaeism are divided into two opposing interpretations , according to which Manichaeism originated in Zoroastrianism with strong Christian influences or , vice versa , in Christianity with strong Zoroastrian influences . No matter which of these two traditional views is held , there is no doubt that the subjects of Jesus were an integral part of Manichaeism .
In Manichaean thought
In original Christian usage , Jesus ' proper name ( traditionally interpreted as `` Yahweh is the help '' ) may or may not be accompanied by the epithet Christ or Messiah , but Christ was also used alone , as if it were a name in itself . By using such epithets , the Fathers of the early church expressed their conviction that Jesus had fulfilled the hope of an eschatological redeemer .
In Gnostic teachings , on the other hand , there was a strong tendency to separate the earthly Jesus , that is , the man Jesus of Nazareth , from the heavenly Christ , the cosmic saviour , a distinction that may already have been foreshadowed in the Judeo-Christian community of the Elcesaites , in which Mani grew up with the idea of a cosmic Jesus suffering on land and in water . The Christian notion of the unique sacrifice of Jesus is not found in Manichaeism , and therefore it appears that Jesus was not essential to Manichean doctrine . In reality , however , he was one of the most popular figures in Manichean writings and at least six different aspects can be distinguished , all of which were of great importance to Manichean beliefs and worship .
Six identities of Jesus
Yeshua ( In Greek : `` Iēsoûs '' ; Latin : `` Iesus '' ; English : `` Jesus '' ) was originally a common name in ancient Palestine ; Christos is a title of Koine Greek origin meaning `` anointed '' , which is a loose translation of the Hebrew title Messiah . The Church Fathers used the combination of the two , Iēsoûs Christos , indicating that Christianity fully affirms that Jesus is the Messiah , i.e . the saviour promised to the Jews in the Bible . In contrast , Gnosticism , with its dualist theology , tends to clearly distinguish the historical Jesus and Christ as God . In Manichaeism , three separate identities of Jesus are distinguished , which are sometimes distinguished further by historians to enumerate at least six distinct aspects of Jesus all of which were of great importance for Manichean belief and worship .
Jesus the Luminous
Jesus the Luminous ( ; also translated as Jesus the Shining , Jesus the Splendour , and Jesus the Radiance ) is the pre-existent aspect of Jesus in Manichaeism , comparable to the eternal Logos in Christianity . He brings knowledge about the secrets of the past , the present and prophecy of the future on one hand , and the ability to differentiate between good and evil towards humanity , on the other . As Jesus the Luminous his primary role was as a revealer and guide ; accordingly , it was Jesus the Luminous who awoke Adam revealed to him the divine origins of his soul and its painful captivity by the body and mixture with matter . Accordingly , it is also Jesus who frees Adam and advises him to eat from the Tree of knowledge to escape the prison of the Prince of Darkness .
This aspect of Jesus is the saviour who redeems the light imprisoned in man ; the redemptive Intelligence , the Great Nous , is the emanation of him . Jesus the Luminous is one of the redeeming deities of the `` third evocation '' ( a series of deities evoked by the Father of Greatness for the purpose of salvation ) and is regarded as an emanation of the Third Messenger , the first member of the third evocation , but , due to its great importance and multiple functions , its position in the divine hierarchy is sometimes represented differently , for example , as Son of Greatness ( that is , of the Father of Greatness ) or Son of the first man ( second member of the `` first evocation '' ) .
He is the Great Wisdom , who is responsible for saving the light molecules imprisoned in the human body . He is the third messenger summoned by the supreme deity of Manichaeism to save the world . The Third Messenger 's act of salvation made the demons anxious and fearful of losing control of the light element , so they created Adam and Eve , the original human ancestors , and imprisoned the light in the human body as a soul . The Light was able to convey to Adam the spiritual knowledge of salvation in order to awaken the sunken souls of humans . But Adam was tempted by Eve to give birth to Cain , Abel and Seth , resulting in the failure of salvation . As mankind continues to reproduce , the soul is subjected to the flesh , and the light element can not escape from the confinement of the Prince of Darkness .
Jesus the Child
Jesus the Child is described as an emanation of Jesus the Luminous with a close relationship to the Suffering Jesus , identified with the embodiment of the soul 's will to redemption .
Jesus the Moon
As Jesus the Luminous has his cosmic seat on the moon , at least in popular belief , the moon itself is identified with Jesus the Luminous . A Sogdian text contains the phrase `` at night when Jesus [ the moon ] rose . ''
Jesus the Risen
The Risen Jesus , or eschatological Jesus , is prophesied to rule over humanity for 120 years after his final judgment and before the great conflagration purifies the remaining redeemable light . From the Coptic sermon on the Great War , in which Jesus the Luminous is depicted as rendering the Last Judgment , it is clear that the aspect of the Risen Jesus was closely related to that of Jesus the Luminous .
Jesus the Messiah
Jesus the Messiah was the historical Jesus of Nazareth who was identified as the prophet of the Jews and the forerunner of Mani who proclaimed the truth and performed miracles . The Manichaeans upheld a monophysite , docetic Christology , believing that he was wholly divine only , having only a spiritual body and not a material one , although appearing on earth as an apostle of light with a human appearance . Consequently , he never experienced human birth , but was truly born only at his baptism , as it was on that occasion that the Father openly acknowledged his sonship . Christ 's changing form and appearance was identified as a `` mystery '' , recalling Augustine 's description of Christ 's . The suffering , death , and resurrection of Jesus the Messiah was in appearance only , exemplary of the suffering and eventual deliverance of the human soul but of no salvific value in itself , although it prefigured Mani 's own martyrdom .
Jesus the Suffering
Suffering Jesus ( ) is identical to the World Soul and the Living Self , which is the light that is imprisoned in matter ; like the historical Jesus , he is depicted crucified in the world . The pain suffered by the imprisoned light was understood to be real and imminent , not merely metaphorical . This constant and universal suffering of the captive soul is expressed in the crucifixion of the Suffering Jesus , who was the `` life and salvation of Man '' , on the cross of light on which he was suspended . This was present not only in every tree , herb , fruit , and vegetable , but even in the stones and the soil of the Earth , as described in the Coptic Manichaean psalms .
Summary
All the aspects of Jesus in Manichaeism can be summed up by a unified concept of a cosmic , suffering and world-saving , `` redeemed redeemer '' figure . Through these aspects , Jesus became an omnipresent and ubiquitous figure in Manichaeism cosmology . However , in each of his aspects Jesus may be represented by more precise mythological entities : Jesus the Luminous by the Great Nous , Suffering Jesus by the World Soul , Jesus the Child by the Enthymesis of Life , Jesus the Moon by the brilliance of the moon , and so on .
In Kephalaia literature
The Kephalaia of the Teacher
While Jesus is only rarely called Jesus the Splendour in other Manichaen writings , he is commonly called as such in the Kephalaia of the Teacher . In the Kephalaia , Jesus is an emanation of the Father of Greatness and apparently identical with the Third Envoy and the living word , brought forth to restore the damage done by the rebellion of the Archons . When Jesus the Splendour descends to the earth , he later takes on the shape of flesh to manifest himself in the material world .
In the 'Praise Jesus ' text
After Manichaeism was introduced into China , because the image of Jesus was quite unfamiliar to Chinese culture , missionaries combined it with Buddhist culture , called Jesus Buddha , and gave him a model of great mercy and relief . Buddhist image . Therefore , believers wrote in the following excerpt from the hymn `` Praise Jesus Text '' , which is like a Buddhist scripture in the Chinese Manichaean hymn scroll :

John William Merrow ( August 15 , 1874 – April 11 , 1927 ) was a New York City theater architect .
Biography
John William Merrow , son of Moses H. and Ella R. A . ( Proctor ) Merrow , was born in New Hampton , New Hampshire . Known throughout his life as `` Will , '' to distinguish him from his at-the-time better-known uncle , John Francis Merrow , he graduated from New Hampton Literary Institute ( now known as New Hampton School ) in 1892 and from the New Hampton Commercial College in 1893 . He graduated from Dartmouth College in 1897 with an A.B . degree and later attended the architectural course at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
His first professional association was with the architectural firm of Wheelwright & Haven in Boston , Massachusetts . In 1900 , he was the architect of the East Blue Hill Library in East Blue Hill , Maine , designed in the American Craftsman style . In 1990 , this structure was added to the National Register of Historic Places . Also in 1900 , he redesigned the interior of the New Hampton Community Church on Main Street in New Hampton , New Hampshire .
He was employed by his uncle Frederick Freeman Proctor ( popularly known as `` F. F. Proctor '' ) , owner of Proctor Theatrical Enterprises in New York City , designing and `` supervising the building of numerous theatres in and out of the city , in addition to keeping all of the houses owned by Mr. Proctor up to modern requirements and standards '' . In 1905 , he was the architect of Proctor 's Palace Theatre and Proctor 's Palace Roof Theatre , on Market Street between Halsey and Washington Streets , in Newark , New Jersey . This was one of the rare `` double decker '' theatres , an eight-story complex with a large 2,300-seat theatre at ground level and a smaller theatre of about 900 seats occupying the top four floors beneath the roof . This theatre is described more fully in Warren G. Harris 's article under Frederick Freeman Proctor .
After 1909 , he was the architect of Frederick Freeman Proctor 's country estate , known as `` Proctoria , '' in Central Valley , New York . He remodeled the old farm house , designed cottages for each of Proctor 's two daughters , and created several lakes . The estate was purchased during World War II by the United States Military Academy ( USMA ) at West Point , for use as a recreation center for cadets . In 1973 , the USMA transferred the estate 's locally famous gatehouse complex ( designed by Merrow ) and the adjacent land to the Woodbury Historical Society in Highland Mills , New York .
In 1921 , he designed the Theta Delta Chi fraternity house in Hanover , New Hampshire on the basis of plans created by Arthur Bradley Barnes .
John William Merrow never married . He was a member of the New York Athletic Club , Dartmouth Club , Technology Club of New York , Theta Delta Chi fraternity , and the Union Lodge of Masons in Bristol , New Hampshire . At the time of his death , he was living in New York City . He is buried in the Merrow family lot in the New Hampton Village Cemetery , New Hampton , New Hampshire .

Nuʿmān ibn Thābit ibn Zūṭā ibn Marzubān ( ; –767 ) , commonly known by his kunya Abū Ḥanīfa ( ) , or reverently as Imam Abū Ḥanīfa by Sunni Muslims , was a Persian Sunni Muslim theologian and jurist who became the eponymous founder of the Hanafi school of Sunni jurisprudence , which has remained the most widely practiced law school in the Sunni tradition , predominates in Central Asia , Afghanistan , Iran ( until the 16th century ) , Balkans , Russia , Chechnya , Pakistan , Bangladesh , Muslims in India , Turkey , and some parts of the Arab world .
Some followers call him al-Imām al-Aʿẓam ( `` The Greatest Imam '' ) and Sirāj al-aʾimma ( `` The Lamp of the Imams '' ) in Sunni Islam .
Born to a Muslim family in Kufa , Abu Hanifa is known to have travelled to the Hejaz region of Arabia in his youth , where he studied in Mecca and Medina . As his career as a theologian and jurist progressed , Abu Hanifa became known for favoring the use of reason in his legal rulings ( faqīh dhū raʾy ) and even in his theology . Abu Hanifa 's theological school is claimed to be what would later develop into the Maturidi school of Sunni theology .
Life
Family background
Abu Hanifa was born in Kufa in 80 AH , 77 AH , 70 AH , or 61 AH , during the reign of the Umayyad Caliphate . Most historians choose the latest view , 80 AH , in accordance with the principle of choosing the latest date death as this is for the purpose of caution .
But Mohammad Zahid Al-Kawthari , adjunct to the office of the last Shaykh Al-Islam of the Ottoman Empire , writes that the middle view , 70 AH , is supported by two facts the others are n't . Firstly , Mohammad Ibn Makhlad Al-Attar considers the narration of Abu Hanifa 's son , Hammad , from Imam Malik Ibn Anas to be an example of an older man narration from a younger man . Secondly , Abu Hanifa was concerned with who should succeed Ibrahim Al-Nakhai after his death in 96 AH . Something that could only happen after Abu Hanifa was slightly older since it 's well known Abu Hanifa only cared about his religious studies after he was about 19 . According to the view of Abu Hanifa being born in 80 AH , Abu Hanifa would have been 16 .
His ancestry is generally accepted as being of Persian origin as suggested by the etymology of the names of his grandfather ( Zuta ) and great-grandfather ( Mah ) . The historian Al-Khatib al-Baghdadi records a statement from Abu Hanifa 's grandson , Ismail ibn Hammad , who gave Abu Hanifa 's lineage as Thabit ibn Numan ibn Marzban and claiming to be of Persian origin . The discrepancy in the names , as given by Ismail of Abu Hanifa 's grandfather and great-grandfather , are thought to be due to Zuta 's adoption of the Arabic name ( Numan ) upon his acceptance of Islam and that Mah and Marzban were titles or official designations in Persia , with the latter , meaning a margrave , referring to the noble ancestry of Abu Hanifa 's family as the Sasanian marzbans . The generally accepted opinion , however , is that most probably he was of Persian ancestry .
His grandfather , Zuta , may have been captured by Muslim troops in Kabul and sold as a slave in Kufa . There , he was purchased and freed by an Arab tribesman of the Taym Allah , a branch of the Banu Bakr . Zuta and his progeny thereafter became clients ( mawali ) of the Taym Allah , hence the sporadic references to Abu Hanifa as 'al-Taymi ' ( i.e . 'of the Taym Allah ' ) . It is otherwise held that his family emigrated from Charikar north of Kabul to Baghdad in the eighth century . The Indian scholar Qazi Athar Mubarakpuri reports from the grandson of Abu Hanifa , who said , `` By God , our family was never a slave to anyone and my grandfather Numan was born in 80 AH . '' Athar also suggests that Zuta had embraced Islam during the reign of Ali and was named Numan .
Early life and scholarship
There is scant biographical information about Abu Hanifa . It is generally known that he worked a producer and seller of `` khazz '' , a type of silk clothing material . He attended lectures on jurisprudence by the Kufan scholar Hammad ibn Abi Sulayman ( d. 737 ) . He also possibly learnt jurisprudence ( fiqh ) by the Meccan scholar Ata ibn Abi Rabah ( d. ) while on Hajj .
Abu Hanifa succeeded Hammad , when the latter died , as the principal authority on Islamic law in Kufa and the chief representative of the Kufan school of jurisprudence . Abu Hanifa gradually gained influence as an authority on legal questions , founding a moderate rationalist school of Islamic jurisprudence that was named after him .
Adulthood and death
In 763 , al-Mansur , the Abbasid caliph offered Abu Hanifa the post of qadi al-qudat ( chief judge of the state ) , but he declined the offer , choosing to remain independent . His student Abu Yusuf was later appointed to the post by Caliph Harun al-Rashid .
In his reply to al-Mansur , Abu Hanifa said that he was not fit for the post . Al-Mansur , who had his own ideas and reasons for offering the post , lost his temper and accused Abu Hanifa of lying .
`` If I am lying , '' Abu Hanifa said , `` then my statement is doubly correct . How can you appoint a liar to the exalted post of a Chief Qadi ( Judge ) ? ''
Incensed by this reply , the ruler had Abu Hanifa arrested , locked in prison and tortured . He was never fed nor cared for . Even there , the jurist continued to teach those who were permitted to come to him .
On 15 Rajab 150 , ( August 15 , 767 ) Abu Hanifa died in prison . The cause of his death is not clear , as some say that Abu Hanifa issued a legal opinion for bearing arms against al-Mansur , and the latter had him poisoned . The fellow prisoner and Jewish Karaite founder , Anan ben David , is said to have received life-saving counsel from Abu Hanifa . It was said that so many people attended his funeral that the funeral service was repeated six times for more than 50,000 people who had amassed before he was actually buried . On the authority of the historian al-Khatib , it can be said that for a full twenty days people performed funeral prayers for him . Later , after many years , the Abu Hanifa Mosque was built in the Adhamiyah neighbourhood of Baghdad . Abu Hanifa also supported the cause of Zayd ibn Ali and Ibrahim al Qamar both Alid Zaydi Imams .
The tomb of Abu Hanifa and the tomb of Abdul Qadir Gilani were destroyed by Shah Ismail of the Safavi Empire in 1508 . In 1533 , Ottomans conquered Baghdad and rebuilt the tomb of Abu Hanifa and other Sunni sites .
Students
Yusuf ibn Abd al-Rahman al-Mizzi listed 97 hadith scholars who were his students . Most of them were famous hadith scholars , and their narrated hadiths were compiled in the Sahih al-Bukhari , Sahih Muslim and other famous books of hadith . Imām Badr al-Din al-Ayni included another 260 students who studied Hadith and Fiqh from Abu Hanifa .
His most famous student was Imām Abu Yusuf , who served as the first chief justice in the Muslim world . Another famous student was Imām Muhammad al-Shaybani , who was the teacher of the Shafi ‘ i school of jurisprudence founder , Imām Al-Shafi ‘ i . His other students include :

Sources and methodology
The sources from which Abu Hanifa derived Islamic law , in order of importance and preference , are : the Qur'an , the authentic narrations of the Muslim prophet Muhammad ( known as hadith ) , consensus of the Muslim community ( ijma ) , analogical reasoning ( qiyas ) , juristic discretion ( istihsan ) and the customs of the local population enacting said law ( urf ) . The development of analogical reason and the scope and boundaries by which it may be used is recognized by the majority of Muslim jurists , but its establishment as a legal tool is the result of the Hanafi school . While it was likely used by some of his teachers , Abu Hanifa is regarded by modern scholarship as the first to formally adopt and institute analogical reason as a part of Islamic law .
As the fourth Caliph , Ali had transferred the Islamic capital to Kufa , and many of the first generation of Muslims had settled there , the Hanafi school of law based many of its rulings on the prophetic tradition as transmitted by those first generation Muslims residing in Iraq . Thus , the Hanafi school came to be known as the Kufan or Iraqi school in earlier times . Ali and Abdullah , son of Masud formed much of the base of the school , as well as other personalities from the direct relatives ( or Ahli-ll-Bayṫ ) of Moḥammad from whom Abu Hanifa had studied such as Muhammad al-Baqir . Many jurists and historians had reportedly lived in Kufa , including one of Abu Hanifa 's main teachers , Hammad ibn Abi Sulayman .
Generational status
Abu Hanifa is regarded by some as one of the Tabi ‘ un , the generation after the Sahaba , who were the companions of the Islamic prophet , Muhammad . This is based on reports that he met at least four Sahaba including Anas ibn Malik , with some even reporting that he transmitted Hadith from him and other companions of Muhammad . Others take the view that Abu Hanifa only saw around half a dozen companions , possibly at a young age , and did not directly narrate hadith from them .
Abu Hanifa was born 67 years after the death of Muhammad , but during the time of the first generation of Muslims , some of whom lived on until Abu Hanifa 's youth . Anas bin Malik , Muhammad 's personal attendant , died in 93 AH and another companion , Abul Tufail Amir bin Wathilah , died in 100 AH , when Abu Hanifa was 20 years old . The author of al-Khairat al-Hisan collected information from books of biographies and cited the names of Muslims of the first generation from whom it is reported that the Abu Hanifa had transmitted hadith . He counted them as sixteen , including Anas ibn Malik , Jabir ibn Abd-Allah and Sahl ibn Sa 'd .
Reception
He attained a very high status in the various fields of sacred knowledge and significantly influenced the development of Muslim theology . During his lifetime , he was acknowledged by the people as a jurist of the highest calibre .
Outside of his scholarly achievements , Abu Hanifa is popularly known amongst Sunni Muslims as a man of the highest personal qualities : a performer of good works , remarkable for his self-denial , humble spirit , devotion and pious awe of God .
His tomb , surmounted by a dome erected by admirers in 1066 is still a shrine for pilgrims . It was given a restoration in 1535 by Suleiman the Magnificent upon the Ottoman conquest of Baghdad .
The honorific title al-Imam al-A'zam ( `` the greatest leader '' ) was granted to him both in communities where his legal theory is followed and elsewhere . According to John Esposito , 45 % of all Muslims follow the Hanafi school .
Abu Hanifa also had critics . The Zahiri scholar Ibn Hazm quotes Sufyan ibn ` Uyaynah : `` [ T ] he affairs of men were in harmony until they were changed by Abù Hanìfa in Kùfa , al-Batti in Basra and Màlik in Medina '' . Early Muslim jurist Hammad ibn Salamah once related a story about a highway robber who posed as an old man to hide his identity ; he then remarked that were the robber still alive he would be a follower of Abu Hanifa .
Connection with the family of Muhammad
As with Malik ibn Anas ( who was a teacher of Imam al-Shafi ' i , who in turn was a teacher of Sunni Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal ) , Imam Abu Hanifa was a student of Ja'far al-Sadiq , who was a descendant of the Islamic Nabi ( Prophet ) Muhammad . Thus all of the four great Imams of Sunni Fiqh are connected to Ja'far from the Bayt ( Household ) of Muhammad , whether directly or indirectly .
In one hadith , Abu Hanifa once said about Imam Ja'far : `` I have not seen anyone with more knowledge than Ja'far ibn Muhammad . '' However , in another hadith , Abu Hanifa said : `` I met with Zayd ( Ja'far 's uncle ) and I never saw in his generation a person more knowledgeable , as quick a thinker , or more eloquent than he was . ''
Opposition to deviations in belief
Imam Abu Hanifa is quoted as saying that Jahm ibn Safwan ( d. 128/745 ) went so far in his denial of anthropomorphism ( Tashbih ) as to declare that 'God is nothing ( Allah laysa bi shay ' ) ' . And Muqatil ibn Sulayman 's extremism ( d. 150/767 ) , on the other side , likened God with His creatures .
Al-Khatib al-Baghdadi narrated in his Tarikh Baghdad ( History of Baghdad ) that Imam Abu Hanifa said :
Works
Confusion regarding Al-Fiqh Al-Akbar
The attribution of Al-Fiqh Al-Akbar has been disputed by A.J . Wensick , as well as Zubair Ali Zai .
Other scholars have upheld that Abu Hanifa was the author such as Muhammad Zahid Al-Kawthari , al-Bazdawi , and Abd al-Aziz al-Bukhari .
Past Scholar , Ibn Abil-'Izz Al-Hanafi even attributed the book to Abu Hanifa
Scholars such as Mufti Abdur-Rahman have pointed out that the book being brought into question by Wensick is actually another work by Abu Hanifa called : `` Al-Fiqh Al-Absat '' .

The Carpentras Stele is a stele found at Memphis in Egypt in 1704 that contains the first published inscription written in the Phoenician alphabet , and the first ever identified ( a century later ) as Aramaic . It remains in Carpentras , in the south of France , at the Bibliothèque Inguimbertine , in a `` dark corner '' on the first floor . Older Aramaic texts were found since the 9th century BC , but this one is the first Aramaic text to be published in Europe . It is known as KAI 269 and CIS II 141 .
It is a funerary dedication to an unknown lady called Taba ; the first line of the image depicts her standing before the god of the underworld with her arms raised and the second , her lying down , dead , being prepared for burial . The textual inscription is typical of Egyptian funerary tablets in that she is described as having done nothing bad in her life , and wishes her well in the presence of Osiris . A long-running scholarly debate has focused on the language of the inscription , and whether it was written as prose or poetry .
It was the first Northwest Semitic ( i.e . Canaanite or Aramaic ) inscription published anywhere in modern times ( the Cippi of Melqart inscriptions , reported ten years earlier in 1694 , were not published in full at that time ) .
It was considered to be Phoenician text at the time of its discovery . Scholars later argued that the inscription was `` Aramaic '' or `` Chaldean '' . Since the early 19th century the language of the inscription has been considered to be Aramaic .
It was first translated in full by Jean-Jacques Barthélemy in the 1760s , and then by Oluf Gerhard Tychsen in 1802 ; the two translations were subsequently compared and critiqued by Ulrich Friedrich Kopp in 1821 , who was in turn quoted by Wilhelm Gesenius in his widely published Scripturae linguaeque Phoeniciae . Kopp criticised Barthélemy and other scholars who had characterized the inscription and some coins as Phoenician , with `` everything left to the Phoenicians and nothing to the Arameans , as if they could not have written at all '' . Kopp noted that some of the words on the stele corresponded to the Aramaic in the Book of Daniel , and in the Book of Ruth .
Initial publication
The stele was first published in 1704 by Jean-Pierre Rigord in an article focused on Rigord 's description of the hieratic script ; the article represented the first recognition of a non-hieroglyphic Egyptian script in modern times . Rigord wrote that `` I have in my Cabinet an Egyptian Monument that I had engraved here , on which there are historical figures , above a Punic inscription . ''
Rigord had a number of plaster casts made and distributed to others in the academic community , mostly in Southern France . The stele was subsequently reviewed by Anne Claude de Caylus , Bernard de Montfaucon and Jean-Jacques Barthélemy . Barthelemy 's review ended an early dispute about the language of the inscription – a consensus formed that the inscription was Phoenician ; this consensus was to last until the beginning of the 19th century .
Poetry
A number of scholars have suggested that the inscription should be translated as a poem , i.e . in metric form . This was first proposed in 1868 by Joseph Derenbourg .
The inscription , in poetic form , was translated by Charles Cutler Torrey as follows :
Blessed is Taba , daughter of Tahapi , devotee of the god Osiris ;
She , who to none did aught of evil , by whom no slander whatever was spoken .
Before Osiris be thou blest , before him take the gift of water ;
Be thou ( his ) worshipper , my fair one , and among his saints be thou complete .
Images
In the top part of the stele , Egyptian god of the underworld Osiris sits on the throne , recognizable with his characteristic crook and flail . Behind him is a goddess dressed in a long skirt ; it could be Isis or Maat . At the table a lady , perhaps the deceased , stands with her arms raised in an adoration pose . In the lower image , the deceased is shown lying on a lion-bed . The embalming god Anubis is shown , assisted by the falcon-headed Horus . The four canopic jugs with the entrails of the deceased are under the bed , with lids likely designed as heads of four sons of Horus : Imset ( human head ) , Hapi ( baboon ) , Duamutef ( jackal ) , Qebehsenuef ( falcon ) . Nephthys kneels at the feet of the dead , and Isis is shown at the head .
Popular culture
The stele featured in three of the letters written by Vincent van Gogh in 1889 to his brother and sister .

The Sirens of TI were a free nightly show provided by the Treasure Island Hotel and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip in Paradise , Nevada . The show entailed a group of sensual and tempting sirens engaging with a band of renegade pirates led by the infamous Blackbeard . The show closed in 2013 .
Story
The show opens with Siren leader `` Sin '' Cinnamon narrating a warning about their power over the sea . Soon afterwards , the adventuring pirate Eros boards the Siren ship The Song , after which he is discovered and overwhelmed by its crew . Eros is bound to the mast and demands his release , threatening the Sirens with the wrath of Captain Mack .
Mack and the pirate crew from The Bull sail into Sirens ' Cove to rescue Eros . The Sirens exchange greetings with the `` salty crew '' of The Bull and Eros asks his crewmates to leave , as he is happy with his new arrangement . The pirates first fire a warning shot across the bow of The Song , and then fire on the warehouse behind the Sirens ' ship , which holds their closet . In retaliation , the Sirens use their power over the ocean to summon a storm to engulf The Bull and sink it to the bottom of the sea .
As The Bull sinks , Captain Mack orders his crew to abandon ship and vows vengeance . The Sirens force Eros to walk the plank , but he and the rest of the pirates soon climb aboard The Song , where a second battle ensues . As the pirates finally realize they 're no match for the Sirens , they decide to surrender and the deck of The Song turns into a 21st-century party .
Battle of Buccaneer Bay
From 1993 to 2003 , Treasure Island featured a battle between pirates aboard the Hispaniola ( which later became the Sirens ' ship , The Song ) and British sailors aboard HMS Britannia ( later the pirate ship The Bull ) , ending in the sinking of HMS Britannia . The Battle of Buccaneer Bay ( in some sources , The Pirate Battle of Buccaneer Bay at Treasure Island ) ran for 16,334 shows .
History
In October 2003 , The Sirens of TI replaced The Battle of Buccaneer Bay , which was geared towards a younger audience and had been playing since Treasure Island opened on October 27 , 1993 . Director and choreographer Kenny Ortega created The Sirens of TI show , inspired by Homer 's Odyssey . Songwriter Emilio Estefan prepared the score and Travis Payne handled show choreography .
The show commemorated its fifth anniversary on October 21 , 2008 when the street leading into the hotel/casino property was renamed from `` Buccaneer Boulevard '' to `` Sirens Cove Boulevard . '' At that time , the show was presented four times daily , at 7 , 8:30 , 10 and 11:30 p.m. Beginning November 3 , 2008 , the show was presented at 5:30 , 7 , 8:30 and 10 p.m. daily .
On October 20 , 2013 , the show was halted for what was intended to be a temporary closure until December 26 , for the construction of retail space nearby . However , in late November 2013 , Treasure Island announced that the closure was permanent , and that some of the space would be used for new shops , surprising several cast members . The new shopping mall reduced the size of Sirens Cove by approximately one-third , and while the ships still exist , the Bull no longer moves ( The Song never moved ) . The cove now features several water fountains , and no show replaced the Sirens of TI .
Statistics
The show featured a cast of sixteen sirens and fourteen pirates . When it started , the cast consisted of thirteen sirens and eleven pirates . It was estimated to cost $ 5 million per year .
More than eighty individual pieces of pyrotechnics were shot per show . Flame effects consumed of liquid propane per show . The sound system had more than 40,000 watts of power . The lagoon contained approximately of reverse-osmosis filtered and reclaimed water , which was deep at many points , extending to depths of at two pits . By 2011 , over the course of 7,440 shows , 630,000 pieces of pyrotechnics had been detonated , of propane had been fired , and The Bull had traveled ( The Song never moved ) .
The original runtime for the show was 28 minutes . Dialogue and choreography tweaks shortened it to 18 minutes by 2005 to better match the patience of the standing crowd . The attendance for the premiere showing at 6 p.m. on October 26 , 2003 was estimated at 5,000 , double the standing capacity of 2,500 ; during the premiere , the crowd spilled from the sidewalk onto Las Vegas Boulevard , forcing the closure of several lanes . It had been viewed by more than 10 million over 4,749 performances by 2008 , and nearly 17 million over 7,440 performances by 2011 .
Reception
Soon after its premiere , Martin Stein wrote `` Sirens is foundering and taking on water '' in his review for the Las Vegas Weekly , adding `` the choreography is boring [ and ] all the action is far too small for a show in which the audience will often be across six lanes of traffic . '' Readers of the Las Vegas Review-Journal voted it the worst local attraction in 2004 and 2005 . The Los Angeles Times advised readers to avoid the show , calling it `` dumb and a major pain to watch . '' Despite the negative feedback , the Las Vegas Weekly later collectively named `` Sirens '' and its pirate show predecessor `` Buccaneer Cove '' the eighth-greatest attraction in Las Vegas history in 2017 . It was also named a `` must-see '' by Michelin .

Lucien Lagrange ( born 1940 in France ) is an architect and a former partner at Skidmore , Owings & Merrill , who founded his own firm , named Lucien Lagrange Architects in 1985 . The studio is a representative of New Urbanism and New Classical Architecture .
Lagrange is a French-born architect who came to Chicago , Illinois after studying at McGill University . He currently lives in a Louis Sullivan designed Lincoln Park community area house . As an architect , he is inspired by Louis Sullivan and Auguste Perret .
He is currently involved in the construction or renovation of seven notable buildings in Chicago , Illinois : 10 East Delaware , Blackstone Hotel , the Waldorf Astoria Chicago , Lincoln Park 2550 , Ritz-Carlton Chicago , 208 South LaSalle and X/O . Lagrange designed the renovation of the Chicago Landmark Carbide & Carbon Building into the Hard Rock Hotel and designed the Park Tower . He has also renovated the Union Station ( Chicago ) and designed the 29 South LaSalle , The Pinnacle , InterContinental Chicago . In 2008 Lagrange designed Manhattan 's ultra luxury 535 West End Avenue , which is one of the most prestigious residential addresses in New York City , as well as the Touraine at 65th and Lexington .
Education
Lagrange grew up in the Provence region of France as the son of a mason . He lived in France until he was eighteen years old when he moved to Montreal , Quebec in 1959 as a high school dropout . He chose Montreal because they speak French . When he arrived in Montreal he worked various odd jobs and eventually felt a desire to become an architect . He returned to school at age twenty-five . He had to take night classes to complete his high school education . Then , he enrolled at Sherbrooke University in engineering . After his first year , he got accepted to McGill University , which was his first choice for architecture study . He obtained his B.Arch . degree in 1972 from McGill .
During his course of study , he was encouraged to find a job with a major architectural firm in 1968 . He came to visit Chicago that year and saw the construction of the John Hancock Center well underway . He had been a draftsman , but now decided to shift from getting odd jobs to getting hired by a major firm . At school , Peter Collins , a professor of his , gave him a book with only the initials S.O.M . on the cover . At the same time he made some business contacts with Ludwig Mies van der Rohe who was working on Westmount Square at a time when Lagrange was doing some shop drawings . He eventually called Mies ' office and requested a job , but was told that they only had enough work to take on a few students and were committed to some from the Illinois Institute of Technology . They said they could refer him to either C.F . Murphy or Skidmore , Owings & Merrill ( S.O.M. ) . Because of the book his professor had given him he chose S.O.M for summer 1968 employment .
His skill as a draftsman quickly got him assigned as a designer for Bruce Graham . He credits his summers with Bruce Graham learning how to combine his technical side with learning the design spectrum to successfully put buildings together . He became a top student at McGill and graduated in 1972 .
Post graduate experience He won his fight , which enables him to freely return to France . He then returned to Montreal to work for Norbert Schoenauer for a year on a multi-family residential housing project in northern Quebec . Then he worked with S.O.M . who were the urban planners for a Canadian Pacific/Bank of Montreal assignment . He then worked on various assignments in Chicago and Montreal until 1978 when he moved to Chicago permanently .
He worked with S.O.M . on broad range of projects : 40-story skyscraper towers , a property in Los Angeles , California , a building with six hundred apartments in Europe , a transportation centre , hotels , and a very diversified hotel property that included a motel , hotel , apartment building , parking structure , office building , retail . Then in 1985 he left to start Lucien Lagrange Architects .
Architecture career
Lagrange has a reputation as Chicago 's architect for the wealthy . In fact , he is considered the go-to guy for classically inspired high-end residential buildings . As such he is known for understanding luxurious lifestyle and incorporating it into designs so that art collections , vast wardrobes , jewelry safes , chefs , florists , and refrigerated fur storage are accommodated . As an employer he has a reputation as an oligarchic ruler .
When he was interviewed in 1997 about his first thirty years in architecture he marvelled at two major transformations . First he noted that the advent of the personal computer has changed the zipatone process . Then he noted that the real estate/architecture has also changed because `` Projects are financed in a very different way , . . . We do n't custom design everything . We use components , which are pre-designed , curtain walls , ceiling tiles . All the systems exist and we just integrate them in the architecture , which also means we can do a set of working drawings a lot faster today . ''
With the Lincoln Park 2550 project , Lagrange is currently endeavoring to design the property 's so that every unit to have a view of a French garden inspired by an 18th-century chateau that once housed Madame de Pompadour .
Lagrange designed the Catalyst , a contemporary-style $ 100 million high-rise condominium planned at the northeast corner of Washington and Des Plaines in Chicago 's Near West Side community area . Real estate developer Gary Rosenberg said , `` Lucien Lagrange , the highly acclaimed award-winning architect for Catalyst , has created a striking geometric 22-story skyscraper , which immediately captures the eye when approaching the Chicago Loop from the [ Kennedy ] expressway . The building 's design is unique with jutting blocks of glass space creating geometric squares and rectangles which seem to float on the building 's façade , along with a strong vertical element which highlights the contemporary sleek style . ''
Lagrange designed the Ritz-Carlton Residences on Chicago 's Magnificent Mile , a 40-story condominium tower built at 664 North Michigan Avenue .
In 1996 , Lucien Lagrange & Associates designed the building to rise at Rush Street and Chicago Avenue on the site then occupied by the 16-story Park Hyatt . In 2008 Lagrange designed Manhattan 's ultra Luxury 535 West End Avenue which is one of the most prestigious residential addresses in New York City .
In 2010 Lagrange closed his office and filed chapter 11 bankruptcy while going through a divorce . `` Mr. Lagrange declines to comment about the firm 's finances and says the Chapter 11 filing was merely a pragmatic business decision he made after deciding it was time to retire . `` < ref > < /ref
Mr. Lagrange is currently designing under the Lucien Lagrange Studio brand and is designing numerous bldgs in Chicago , Dallas and California
Mr Lagrange has remarried in 2018 to Melinda Jakovich-Lagrange and lives in Chicago .

Themes
Colorism
Bennett explores the issue of colorism throughout the book . In the novel , an ex-slave named Alphonse Decuir established a town called Mallard for only light-skinned people . This leads to a fixation among the town about lightness coupled by a disgust for dark-skinned people . Jude , who is the daughter of the main character , is bullied for the darker color of her skin in school and is called names such as `` Tar Baby '' and `` Blueskin . '' The townspeople also view Desiree 's relationship with Early , who is a dark skinned man , as unfathomable because to them dark-skinned people were undesirable . Throughout Desiree and Stella 's childhood , their mother Adele warns them against dark-skinned men . The books explore the effects of colorism and the lengths people go to in order to be accepted as beautiful or lighter .
Domestic abuse
Domestic abuse is another themes of the book as it manifests in the main character Desiree 's struggles with abuse from her darker-skinned husband Sam . In the novel , Sam physically and emotionally abuses Desiree until she eventually runs away with her daughter Jude back to Mallard . On some occasions , Desiree tries to rationalize the abuse from her husband and attributes it to his frustrations with the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. , as well as the riots that erupted around that time and his desire to have another child . It highlights how domestic violence victims often try to rationalize the actions of their abusers and are reluctant to leave them .
Reception
The novel debuted at number one on The New York Times fiction best-seller list for the week ending June 6 , 2020 . As of the week ending April 24 , 2021 , the novel has spent 42 weeks on the list .
At the review aggregator website bookmarks , which assigns individual ratings to book reviews from mainstream literary critics , indicated that the novel received a cumulative `` Rave '' rating based on 38 reviews , with only one `` mixed '' review . Publishers Weekly wrote , `` Bennett renders her characters and their struggles with great compassion , and explores the complicated state of mind that Stella finds herself in while passing as white . '' In its starred review , Kirkus Reviews wrote , `` The scene in which Stella adopts her white persona is a tour de force of doubling and confusion . '' The Washington Post called The Vanishing Half a `` fierce examination of contemporary passing and the price so many pay for a new identity '' . The New York Times wrote , `` Bennett balances the literary demands of dynamic characterisation with the historical and social realities of her subject matter . ''
It was selected for the New York Times Book Reviews `` 10 Best Books of 2020 '' list .

John Flett ( 28 September 1963 – 19 January 1991 ) was a British fashion designer who achieved early success with his own brand before designing briefly for Claude Montana . He died of a heart attack at the age of 27 , while working in Florence .
Sue Chowles , who had a work placement with Flett before working in fashion and later as a fashion academic , has said : `` He would have been more influential than Galliano now ... he was the most inspirational pattern cutter , a true genius '' . The Independent included John Flett at number 17 in an article about 50 great British fashion moments , saying : `` Flett 's last collection in London was exquisite , watery , shimmery and full of ideas '' .
Early life
John Flett was from a Jewish background , according to his friend and former `` soulmate '' John Galliano – who has described Flett as : `` the love of his life '' . After studying fashion and textiles at West Sussex College of Design . He then moved on to Central Saint Martins ( then St Martins ) , where he studied fashion under Sheilagh Brown . Brown would later say : `` When John Flett came for his interview his work was incredible , one of the tutors said not to give him a place as he looked like trouble . I replied 'that kind of trouble I love ' . ''
At Central Saint Martins , Flett was part of a hothouse of talent – both in fashion and the London scene ; his early 1980s peer group included not only Galliano , but also Stephen Jones , Darla Jane Gilroy , Sade and Chris Sullivan .
Flett 's work attracted attention and his graduation collection was bought by key names , including Joseph Ettedgui ( head of the London-based Joseph retail empire ) and by buyers for Bloomingdales in New York .
Career
From 1985 , Flett became a part of the London high-fashion scene , exhibiting at London Fashion Week and at New York and Paris fashion weeks . Menswear was introduced to his range in 1986 and in 1987 he added a diffusion ( lower-priced ) line . By 1988 , John Flett designs were available worldwide in 70 stores .
Brand hallmarks
The Guardian described Flett 's brand signature as distinctively different for the times : `` Along with John Galliano , who was a [ sic ] schoolfriend , he pioneered a new type of bias-cutting technique which imbued garments with a special fluidity and grace '' .
Kevin Almond has said : `` much of Flett 's skill was in his cutting , intricate and inventive , with which he developed clothes that seemed to cling to the body . In fact , many of his garments were difficult to understand on the hanger and needed to be worn to be appreciated '' . Sue Chowles , who worked with him on his spring/summer 1989 collection as an intern while studying at the Royal College of Art , has described his technique in more detail : `` he never patterns cut his designs – instead he would drape the fabric and create the pattern on a mannequin '' .
Not all his early catwalk collections attracted acclaim . Writing in The Times about his first show in spring 1988 , Liz Smith said that he : `` has to learn to polish his act '' . But there was no doubt about his appeal to most of the British press and fashion buyers . An interview and double-page spread of photos of his collection in The Observer described his autumn 1988 catwalk show as : `` triumphant '' . The interviewer said Flett 's trademarks were about intricacy , involving clever draping on items such as a backless dress with no visible means of support . She described his finale outfit as : `` a wondrous white creation that looked like a cross between a meringue and a crinkle-cut crisp '' .
Later career and death
Despite the acclaim from both buyers and majority of the British fashion press , Flett was unable to sustain his business venture . His business affairs were described as a `` rocky road '' and he parted company with his backers in 1988/9 .
He moved on to Paris to work for Claude Montana on the designer 's debut collection for Lanvin . Flett relocated to Florence in 1990 , where he worked for Italian designer Enrico Coveri on a menswear range ( Coveri died in 1990 ) .
Flett 's obituaries in both The Times and The Guardian noted that at the time of his death , aged 27 , he was on the point of signing a contract with the Milan fashion house Zuccoli to create a womenswear collection and relaunch his career .

Ethiopian Airlines Flight 708 was a Boeing 720-060B , due to operate an international scheduled Addis Ababa–Asmara–Athens–Rome–Paris passenger service , that experienced a hijacking attempt on 8 December 1972 .
Summary
Minutes after departing from Haile Selassie I International Airport bound for Paris , when the aircraft was flying at some , seven members of the Eritrean Liberation Front stood up and tried to gain control of the plane . A hand grenade that was armed by one of the hijackers was rolled down the aisle by a passenger . The grenade exploded in the rear part of the fuselage , some off the plane 's centreline , blowing a hole in the cabin floor and damaging or severing several controls of the aircraft , including those of throttle of two engines , of the rudder , and of the horizontal stabiliser . Despite this , the crew turned back the airplane to the airport of origin and managed to land it safely ; it sustained minor damages that were repaired later .
Security guards —there were six of them aboard— opened fire at the terrorists , killing six of the hijackers on board , while the seventh one died in a hospital .

A checkbox ( check box , tickbox , tick box ) is a graphical widget that permits the user to make a binary choice , i.e . a choice between one of two possible mutually exclusive options . For example , the user may have to answer 'yes ' ( checked ) or 'no ' ( not checked ) on a simple yes/no question .
Checkboxes are shown as ☐ when unchecked , or ☑ or ☒ ( depending on the graphical user interface ) when checked . A caption describing the meaning of the checkbox is normally shown adjacent to the checkbox . Inverting the state of a checkbox is done by clicking the mouse on the box , or the caption , or by using a keyboard shortcut , such as the space bar .
Often , a series of checkboxes is presented , each with a binary choice between two options . Then the user may select several of the choices . Contrasting is a radio button , in which only a single option is selectable from several mutually-exclusive choices .
Checkboxes may be disabled ( indicated `` greyed out '' ) to inform the user of their existence and possible use despite momentary unavailability .
Tri-state checkbox
Some applications use checkboxes that allow an indeterminate state in addition to the two provided by a normal checkbox . This third state is shown as a square or dash in the checkbox , and indicates that its state is neither checked nor unchecked . This is most often used when the checkbox is tied to a collection of items in mixed states . The indeterminate state can not usually be selected by the user , and switches to a checked state when activated .
For example , a checkbox presented to select files to send via FTP might use a tree view so that files can be selected one at a time , or by folder . If only some of the files in a folder are selected , then the checkbox for that folder would be indeterminate . Clicking on this indeterminate checkbox would select all or , less commonly , none of the contained files . Continuing to click on the checkbox would alternate between checked ( all sub-directories and files selected ) and unchecked ( no sub-directories or files selected ) .
Some tri-state checkbox implementations allow the user to toggle among all states , including the indeterminate state , by remembering the mixed state of the items in the collection . This serves as an undo feature .
Not actionable
Setting or clearing a checkbox changes the checkbox 's state with no other side-effects . Violating this guideline by associating additional actions with the change of state frequently confuses users , because they are used to configuring data in entry controls such as text boxes , radio buttons , and checkboxes and then invoking an action control such as a push button to initiate the action to process the data .
One common exception is to enable or display additional user input elements whose relevance depends on the checkbox state . In other situations toggle switch is typically used instead of a checkbox .
HTML
In web forms , the HTML element is used to display a checkbox .

The Detroit Pistons are an American professional basketball team based in Detroit , Michigan . They play in the Central Division of the Eastern Conference in the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) . The team , owned by Tom Gores , plays its home games at Little Caesars Arena . The franchise was founded in 1941 by Fred Zollner as the Fort Wayne Zollner Pistons , playing in the National Basketball League ( NBL ) . In 1948 , the team was renamed to the Fort Wayne Pistons and joined the Basketball Association of America ( BAA ) , which merged with the NBL to become the NBA a year later . After spending nine seasons in Fort Wayne , Indiana , Zollner moved the team to Detroit , Michigan in 1957 to be able to compete financially with other big city teams . In the 1980s , general manager Jack McCloskey was instrumental in the Pistons ' future championship runs by drafting Isiah Thomas , acquiring key players like Joe Dumars and Dennis Rodman and hiring head coach Chuck Daly . The 1980s team , known today as `` the Bad Boys '' due to the physical playing style , eventually won two championships in the 1989 and 1990 NBA Finals under Daly . The Pistons won their third and most recent title in the 2004 NBA Finals under the tenure of Larry Brown .
There have been 36 head coaches for the Pistons franchise since joining the NBA . The franchise 's first head coach while in the NBA was Carl Bennett , who coached the team for six games , all of which are losses . Chuck Daly is the franchise 's all-time leader in regular-season games coached ( 738 ) , regular-season games won ( 467 ) , playoff games coached ( 113 ) , and playoff games won ( 71 ) ; Flip Saunders is the franchise 's all-time leader in regular-season winning percentage ( .715 ) . Daly and Larry Brown are the only members of the franchise to have been inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame as coaches ; Daly was also selected as one of the top 10 coaches in NBA history . Both Ray Scott and Rick Carlisle have won NBA Coach of the Year in the end , with the Pistons respectively . Former coach Dick Vitale was named to the Basketball Hall of Fame in honor of the work he did as a basketball broadcaster after leaving the Pistons . Sixteen head coaches have spent their entire NBA head coaching careers with the Pistons . Curly Armstrong , Red Rocha , Dick McGuire , Dave DeBusschere , Donnie Butcher , Terry Dischinger , Earl Lloyd , Scott , and Michael Curry formerly played for the team . The current head coach of the Pistons is Dwane Casey .

Outlaws is a first-person shooter developed and published by LucasArts in April 7 , 1997 . Set in the Wild West , it follows retired U.S . Marshal James Anderson , who seeks to bring justice to a gang of criminals who killed his wife and kidnapped his daughter . It uses an enhanced version of the Jedi game engine , first seen in Star Wars : Dark Forces . It is also largely credited as the first shooter game with a sniper zoom , as well as one of the first to feature a gun reloading mechanic . LucasArts ' INSANE animation engine was used to render computer graphics animation sequences . These have special filters to look hand-drawn , and play between each mission and set up the action in the next area .
The game received generally favorable reviews from critics . While the graphics were often the topic of scrutiny and comparison to better looking titles of the time , such as Quake , reviewers were largely unanimous in praising the game 's orchestral soundtrack , composed by Clint Bajakian , and solid gameplay . The voice cast includes veteran talent such as John de Lancie , Richard Moll and Jack Angel . A free expansion , entitled Handful of Missions , was released in 1998 . Community-created expansion levels are also available and have received media coverage . Although not a huge financial success , the game has a cult following .
Gameplay
Outlaws is a first-person shooter . Players control the character as he utilizes several American Old West weapons and items , such as a rifle , shotgun , dynamite and revolver . The player can activate the lantern inventory item to lighten dark areas , and use a shovel in specific areas to dig holes . In the lower difficulty levels , termed Good and Bad , the player is able to sustain several bullet wounds with no apparent ill effects . In the hardest difficulty level , Ugly , the player 's resistance is reduced to one or two shots . This forces the player into a different style of play . Where on the easier difficulty levels a player might charge into a gunfight heedless of Anderson 's personal health , in Ugly mode , the player must use stealth and cover to win .
Aside from the main single player campaign , Outlaws includes a set of five discrete missions that chronicle Anderson 's rise to the rank of U.S . Marshal . Each of the missions requires Anderson to either capture or kill a specific outlaw . Ranks ( Deputy , Sheriff , and Marshal ) are awarded on the accumulation of a set number of points . Points are awarded for recovering stolen gold , capturing/killing the outlaw , and for killing enemies . Each outlaw that the player captures or kills appears in a jail cell in Anderson 's field office . More points are awarded for capturing an outlaw than for killing one , due to the difficulty in capturing one alive . Completion of the Historical Missions is not a requirement for playing the single player campaign .
Outlaws also features a multiplayer deathmatch in for variants , including a Kill the Fool with the Chicken mode . Multiplayer can be played over local area network , and it was one of the featured games on the MSN Gaming Zone before its demise . The player can assume the role of one of six characters from the main game : Matt `` Dr. Death '' Jackson , `` Bloody '' Mary Nash , James Anderson , Chief Two-Feathers , `` Gentleman '' Bob Graham , and `` Spittin ' '' Jack Sanchez . Each character has its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of speed/maneuverability , weapons selection , and resistance .
Plot
James Anderson , a retired U.S . Marshal , comes home after a trip to the general store to find his wife Anna dying and that his daughter Sarah has been kidnapped by two outlaws known as Matt `` Dr. Death '' Jackson and `` Slim '' Sam Fulton , under the employ of the railroad baron Bob Graham . Graham has hired several wanted outlaws to `` enlighten '' the people of the county to sell their land to him , so that he can make a profit off of a huge railroad . However , the psychotic Dr. Death misinterprets Graham 's meaning of enlightenment , attacks Anna and leaves her for dead , kidnaps Anderson 's daughter , and burns his home to the ground . After burying his wife , the retired Marshal picks up his gun once again and rides off to find his daughter . He travels around the old West , shooting his way through each member of Graham 's hired outlaws .
On his journey Anderson is haunted by dreams of his father 's murder as a child . He recalls that while the two were camping out in the wild , an unknown assailant shot his father in his sleep for no specific reason , but left young James alive , telling him `` to keep that fear [ of death ] , kid '' . After questioning more and more outlaws , Anderson is confronted by Dr. Death in an old mine . Anderson eventually gets the drop on him ; he gets tangled up in a rope above a deep mine shaft . Dr. Death tells him that his daughter is hidden in an old Indian cliff village . After finding out that Anderson is not going to let him out of the pit , he teases Anderson about the murder of his wife . Anderson is enraged and puts his cigar in the pulley from which the rope is hanging , eventually burning up the rope and sending Dr. Death plummeting to his demise at the bottom of the shaft .
At the Indian village , Anderson is ambushed by renegade Indian Two Feathers . After defeating him , Two Feathers praises Anderson 's strength in battle , and out of sympathy because he once had a child he had lost , tells him the real location of Sarah : Bob Graham 's estate , Big Rock ranch . Anderson blasts his way into Graham 's villa , and finally confronts him . After a fierce gunfight , Graham is believed dead and falls to the ground , and Anderson reunites with his daughter . Graham , clinging to life and gun trained on Anderson , reveals that he was the one who murdered Anderson 's father . Just as Graham is about to finish off Anderson , Sarah manages to shoot Graham with Anderson 's gun avenging her grandfather 's death . After a tearful reunion , father and daughter ride into the sunset .
Development
Outlaws is powered by an upgraded version of the Jedi engine , which was previously used on Star Wars : Dark Forces . LucasArts ' INSANE animation engine is used to display the game 's cutscenes . The game was also originally planned to have 12 unique multiplayer characters , each with their own in-game attributes . The final release halved that number to six characters . The game was inspired by western films such as The Good , the Bad and the Ugly and A Fistful of Dollars , as well as other Clint Eastwood westerns . It was released for Microsoft Windows on April 7 , 1997 . It is the first video game to feature a sniper zoom , and one of the earliest examples of a reloading mechanic . Despite the serious tone of the game , Outlaws maintained a few Easter egg jokes , including Max of the Sam & Max series , hidden inside a building , a pair of grey aliens experimenting on a cow , and several references to the Indiana Jones series of games and movies .
In 1997 , LucasArts released a patch to update the game to version 1.1 to add Glide and Aureal A3D , and another one to add Direct3D compatibility to the game in 2001 , complementing the existing software rendering support . Shortly after the initial release , a small official expansion pack called the Handful of Missions was released for free . It added four single player missions as well as multiplayer maps and updated the game to version 2.0 . Outlaws is listed as one of noted game designer John Romero 's all-time favorite games . On March 19 , 2015 , Disney Interactive re-released the game for Digital distribution on GOG.com . In contrast , the community-created XL Engine allows players to use their original CD to play through the game with a modern setting .
In 1998 , LucasArts released a set of four single player missions , called the Handful of Missions , for download from the official website . The package includes several new multiplayer missions , and a patch to update the game to version 2.0 . The single player missions take place outside of the original game 's story , and each level is unrelated to the next . Third party levels have been created by the game 's community . On April 5 , 2013 GameSpot and several other media outlets organized a playthrough of several LucasArts games to honor the then recently closed developer . GameSpot staff noted that the `` community for [ Outlaws ] has created like 75 user generated maps . '' In reality more than 1,500 custom multiplayer maps have been created since Outlaws was released , and maps continued to be released until late 2012 .
Music for the game was scored by composer Clint Bajakian . An orchestra was used with authentic instruments which was uncommon at that time . In total , Mixed Mode CD contains fifteen different audio tracks which were suitable for playback on a regular CD player . It is noteworthy that the crystal case of the game 's original release had a tracklist printed on its back side as it is the case with most normal audio CDs .
Several veteran actors lend their voices to the game . John de Lancie portrays Matt Jackson , Richard Moll of Night Court plays Bob Graham . Veteran voice actor Jack Angel portrays two characters , George Bowers and Jack Sanchez . Jeff Osterhage , himself a veteran of western television films , voices the game 's protagonist , U.S . Marshal James Anderson .
Reception
Outlaws received mostly positive reviews from critics . It has been featured in multiple Best Of lists since its release . Complex.com writer Gus Turner included it in his list of The 25 Best LucasArts Games . Of its legacy Turner said it was not a `` major financial success , the title has only been able to attract a cult following since its release . '' Brittany Vincent of ShackNews placed it on her list of Five LucasArts Classics Ripe for Remakes , and noted that it `` deserves another chance to woo gamers . ''
Next Generation stated that `` Outlaws uses the Dark Forces engine , and it shows . The graphics are a bit outdated , a bit disorienting , and more than a bit pixelated in close . The game 's saving grace is its plot , admittedly and oft-overlooked aspect of this genre . ''
GameSpot reviewer Chris Hudak commended the game 's story and cinematic cutscenes , calling it a `` movie-worthy experience '' and citing the cinematic and musical influences of Sergio Leone 's spaghetti westerns and Ennio Morricone 's scores , respectively ; he overall praised the game and called it `` the most complete and faithful Old West shooter in the industry to date '' . In a retrospective review of the game , Kotaku editor Luke Plunkett praised the game 's soundtrack and called the multiplayer `` excellent . '' Plunkett cited the release of the visually superior Quake a year earlier and Half-Life not long after as factors that led to the game fading into obscurity for most players . The Escapist '' 's Stew Shearer gave high marks for the game 's villains ; he called them `` fun to hate . '' He stated that Outlaws `` is n't just Doom with cowboys ; you can tell that the developers put some real hard work into making the player feel like they 're the hero in a Sergio Leone flick . '' The reviewer for Computer Games Magazine noted that while the game did not look as visually appealing as its competitors , other developers should `` show as much thought in level and multiplayer design . ''
Some reviewers were more critical of the game . The reviewer for Computer Gaming World said that `` There 's nothing really wrong with Outlaws . There just is n't much right with it . '' The reviewer noted that the game had excellent music and art , but felt that the game had nothing new or innovative to offer players . Edge magazine 's reviewer stated that `` not for the first time , shown that it 's not infallible . '' Charlie Brooker of PC Zone ( UK ) had to take time to warm up to the game . `` when you start playing Outlaws , it feels downright cruddy . '' Brooker stated that after a lengthy amount of play his opinion changed , and ultimately he gave the game a favorable review.Computer Gaming World gave the soundtrack for Outlaws its 1997 `` Musical Achievement '' award . Outlaws was a finalist for the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences ( AIAS ) Interactive Achievement Awards 1998 for `` Outstanding Achievement in Sound and Music '' Award , which ultimately went to PaRappa the Rapper . In 2008 IGN selected the soundtrack from Outlaws '' to its `` 10 Great Videogame Albums '' list .

The Letter of Peter to Philip is a Gnostic Christian epistle found in the Nag Hammadi Library in Egypt . It was dated to be written around late 2nd century to early 3rd century CE and focuses on a post-crucifixion appearance and teachings of Jesus Christ to the apostles on the Mount of Olives , or Mount Olivet .
Overview
The Letter of Peter to Philip , found in the cache of texts at Nag Hammadi and bound into Codex VIII , contains a brief letter purporting to be from Saint Peter to Saint Philip , followed by a narrative and Gnostic discourse upon the nature of Christ . It was probably written in the late 2nd century or the beginning of the 3rd , originally in Greek , but translated into Coptic in the Nag Hammadi text . The title of the Letter is originally `` The Letter of Peter Which He Sent to Philip '' , but is commonly simplified to `` The Letter of Peter to Philip '' . Another copy of the letter has more recently been found in the Codex Tchacos and is titled plainly as `` The Letter of Peter to Philip '' .
The Nag Hammadi Library
The Nag Hammadi Library is a collection of thirteen codices that was found near the Egyptian city of Nag Hammadi in 1945 . Many writings found in this library are referred to as “ Gnostic Gospels ” because most of the documents contain Gnostic teachings that conflicted with the beliefs of proto-orthodox Christianity , which at the time was becoming the predominant form of Christianity . Therefore , most were rejected from the canon as Orthodox Christianity was formed in the early centuries C.E .
Summary of the text
The Letter of Peter to Philip begins with a greeting from the apostle Peter , the presumed author of this letter . It continues with Peter speaking directly to Philip , expressing his ( Peter 's ) wish that Philip rejoin the apostles in their evangelization mission . When Philip and the apostles meet on the Mount Olives , they prayed together twice , each time emphasizing light as a symbol of Jesus . After their prayers , the apostles are visited by a great light from the sky identifying itself as “ Jesus Christ who is with you forever ” . He began teaching the apostles of the aeons and their pleroma , followed by a series of questions from apostles about their struggles against the archons and how much they must suffer for the sake of their faith . Once the light disappeared from them , the apostles left the Mount Olives to go to Jerusalem , continuing their evangelization .
Analysis and scholarly reception
The Letter of Peter to Philip is the last concluding tractate of the Nag Hammadi Codex VIII . Its predecessor is the Sethian text , Zostrianos . It is speculated by scholars that the Letter of Peter to Philip was chosen as the last tractate for its convenience of brevity . This is supported by the fact that the Letter and Zostrianos share little theological or literary relationship . The Letter uses passages that are reminiscent of the Gospel of John and Acts of the Apostles which indicates that the author may have attempted to classify the text as one of the acts of the apostles .
The Letter is considered to be Petrine in nature because of Peter 's position as the leader of the apostles . The addressee of the Letter , Saint Philip , is portrayed as submissive , answering to Saint Peter 's authority . In early Christianity , there was a conflict between the traditions associated with Peter and Philip . This letter is supposed by some scholars to be a `` Petrine document designed to promote Peter 's primacy in the early church . '' In addition , this document attempts to claim true apostolic authority by connecting the teachings Jesus gives in this post-crucifixion appearance with those he delivered during his earthly ministry . This would have been a bold assertion in the face of the proto-orthodox Christianity that was gaining power over other types of early Christianity .

Forbury Gardens is a public park in the town of Reading in the English county of Berkshire . The park is on the site of the outer court of Reading Abbey , which was in front of the Abbey Church . The site was formerly known as the Forbury , and one of the roads flanking the current gardens is still known as The Forbury . Fairs were held on the site three times a year until the 19th century .
The gardens are listed as Grade II in the English Heritage Register of Historic Parks and Gardens .
Forbury , a suburb of the New Zealand city of Dunedin , was named after the gardens by early resident William Henry Valpy , who was born in Reading .
History
Early years
Reading Abbey was founded in 1121 , by Henry I , and for the next four centuries it dominated the town , becoming one of the most influential establishments in England . Like other such monasteries , Reading had a forbury , or 'borough in front ' , an area of open land which provided a meeting place between the Abbey and the town . The Forbury in Reading was part of the outer court of the Abbey , and provided a marketplace as well as a meeting place .
In 1150 , what is now Forbury Hill was constructed to help fortify the Abbey during the civil war between King Henry I 's daughter Matilda and his nephew Stephen .
The abbey was largely destroyed in 1538 during Henry VIII 's Dissolution of the Monasteries . The last abbot , Hugh Cook Faringdon , was tried and convicted of high treason , and hanged , drawn and quartered in front of the Abbey Church . After this , the buildings of the abbey were extensively looted , with lead , glass and facing stones removed for reuse elsewhere , and the focus of the town moved away from the Forbury .
Reading suffered badly during the English Civil War , being occupied at different times by both sides . During the Siege of Reading ( 1642–43 ) , the Royalist garrison built defences that further damaged the remains of the Abbey , and Forbury Hill was used as a gun emplacement .
As a result of the concerns sparked in England by the French Revolution , and throughout the ensuing Napoleonic Wars , the Forbury was used for military drills and parades , in addition to its well-established use for fairs and circuses . Three annual fairs were generally held on the Forbury , but the most significant was the Michaelmas Fair , held in September . This fair became known as the Reading Cheese Fair , although cattle , horses and hops were also sold , and it served as the principal local hiring fair .
19th century
By the first years of the 19th century , the western part of the Forbury was in use as a playground or sports ground for Reading School , which at this time was housed in the former Hospitium of St John . However the whole of the Forbury was in private ownership , and disputes were common as to the common rights of the town and the rights of the school .
In 1854 , Forbury Hill and the eastern section of the present gardens were sold to Reading Corporation at the cost of £1200 , of which £400 was donated by the previous owner , a Mr Wheble . The resulting gardens were planned with a 'botanical character ' , a fountain and a summer house , and became known as the Pleasure Gardens . Work started in 1855 and the Pleasure Gardens opened on Easter Sunday 1856 . A tunnel was built on the eastern side in 1859 to link the gardens and the Abbey ruins .
The success of the Pleasure Gardens contrasted with the situation in the western part of the Forbury , which was still used for fairs . After one fair , the area was described as being covered 'with heaps of oyster shells , manure and other refuse ' . In 1860 , this section of the Forbury was purchased by the town for £6010 from Colonel Blagrave . It was decided that fairs should no longer be held there , but the emphasis remained on recreational use rather than botanical display , with the area grassed except for the outside walks and a gravelled parade ground .
The common ownership notwithstanding , the two halves of the Forbury remained very different in character , and separated by a wall . However in 1869 the town purchased of King 's Meadow , the abbey 's former water meadow by the River Thames , as a recreation ground . This paved the way for the incorporation , in 1873 , of the western part of the Forbury into the gardens , which then became known as Forbury Gardens .
The Maiwand Lion statue was erected in 1886 to commemorate the loss of 286 soldiers ( though the exact number varies by account ) from the 66th Royal Berkshire Regiment at the Battle of Maiwand in Afghanistan on 27 July 1880 . The sculptor of this 31-foot statue was George Blackall Simonds and it was unveiled in December 1886 . It is sometimes known locally as the Forbury Lion .
A cross memorializing Henry I was put up , at about the same time as the Maiwand Lion , on the north-west corner of the footings of the Abbey Church . The Victoria Gates on the southern side of the gardens commemorate Queen Victoria 's Diamond Jubilee in 1897 .
21st century
In 2015 , a statue was unveiled to the memory of Trooper Fred Potts VC , who was awarded the Victoria Cross in October 1915 after endangering his own life to drag a wounded comrade from the battlefield at the Battle of Scimitar Hill . The statue is just outside the garden wall , facing the Crown Court building . In the same year , the Reading International Brigade Memorial was relocated from the Civic Centre to the east side of the gardens , and rededicated .
On 20 June 2020 , three people were killed and three others seriously injured in a mass stabbing at the Forbury Gardens . The incident is being treated as a terrorist incident .
The gardens today
A grand re-opening event took place on 14 May 2005 to mark the completion of a one-year restoration project . The Heritage Lottery Fund awarded Reading Borough Council £2.13 million to restore the historic features of the Forbury Gardens and improve safety and access for visitors . The scheme was developed in consultation with residents and interested local groups .
Work in the gardens themselves has included the restoration of the Maiwand Lion , the bandstand , water feature and the garden 's walls , fencing and gateways . A new Keeper 's Lodge also includes a refreshment kiosk , public toilets and facilities for a resident gardener . Reading Borough Council organises summer concerts in the bandstand on Sunday afternoons during July and August .
After the restoration , closed-circuit cameras monitor the whole Gardens area , in a bid to deter drug use and anti-social behaviour . The garden has received a Green Flag Award for being welcoming , safe , well maintained and involving the community .
The Forbury Hill is now accessible by two winding footpaths ( wheelchair-accessible ) that lead to an area that is elevated about 3 metres above the surrounding gardens . A single plane tree stands in the middle , and around the outer edge of the top of the hill are wooden seats .

Rose trial grounds or rose test gardens are agricultural areas where garden roses are grown to be assessed for qualities such as health , floriferousness , novelty , and scent .
Roses on trial are usually considered for awards of merit or medals at the end of the trial period . Roses that win an award may be more likely to have commercial success . Forty per cent of all roses sold in the U.S. have won All-America Rose Selections . Similarly , the UK Rose of the Year award usually guarantees that a particular variety will be widely available at garden centres and through mailorder rose suppliers .
Testing
Typically , roses are grown for two years in a test area ( usually a dedicated rose bed ) to judge them over a period of time , In the UK the trial grounds are from 2020 , at Rochfords in Hertford where the new roses are judged on the trial grounds over a three-year growing period . In the United States the All-America Rose Selections ( AARS ) , which were first introduced in 1938 , were awarded annually until 2013 based on the results of testing in 21 gardens across the US over a two-year period . Roses which scored highly across all judging areas in a variety of climates were awarded this national award . Since 2013 , two separate multi-site rose trialing programs have emerged . The first , the American Garden Rose Selections ( AGRS ) is very similar to AARS , while the second , the American Rose Trials for Sustainability ( ARTS ) takes a thoroughly scientific approach . Another multi-site trial is the ADR in Germany .
In most cases , roses are identified by a number during the trial period , with their identity not revealed until after final judging . A local panel of judges may assess them throughout the trial period , although at some trials there may be an invited national or international panel . Roses are generally judged within a category , such as Hybrid Tea , Floribunda , or patio rose , to fairly compare like styles . There are specific awards for fragrance , which are judged across all categories .
History
Parc de Bagatelle in Paris hosted the first international competition in 1907 . This event , known as the Concours international de roses nouvelles de Bagatelle ( International competition for new roses ) , has taken place annually ever since and remains one of the world 's top rose competitions .
A formalised international rose trial scheme was established in 1928 by the Royal National Rose Society ( then known as the National Rose Society ) in Britain , although the society had been awarding gold medals to the best new roses grown by its membership since 1883 .
Over succeeding decades , trial grounds have been established in most major rose growing countries . Often they are located in botanic gardens and parks . Some countries have several trial grounds to assess roses in a variety of climates and soils . The first rose trial ground in the southern hemisphere ( where rose seasons and growing conditions may be very different from the northern hemisphere ) was established in New Zealand in 1969 as a partnership between the national rose society and Palmerston North city council .

History
The Raccoon River Conference was once a small school conference . The conference was made up of Bondurant–Farrar , Norwalk , Madrid , Woodward-Granger , Interstate 35 in Truro , Waukee , Dallas Center-Grimes , and Adel–De Soto at its outset . While the outer regions of the Des Moines metro began to experience growth , Bondurant–Farrar and Ogden decided to leave for the smaller Heart of Iowa Conference , while I-35 joined the Pride of Iowa Conference . Woodward-Granger soon followed their former members to the HOI conference . This flurry of change saw the league reform itself . By 1998 , there were 14 members in the conference , competing in two divisions . The league now consisted of A-D-M , Ballard , Carlisle , Carroll , Dallas Center-Grimes , Jefferson–Scranton , Nevada , North Polk , Perry , Prairie City-Monroe , Saydel , Waukee , West Central Valley , and Winterset . Over the next two years , North Polk , Prairie City-Monroe , Waukee , and W.C. Valley all joined different conferences , leaving the league with ten teams . In 2007 , Jefferson–Scranton left for the Heart of Iowa Conference . Nevada followed them there in 2009 , the same year Boone joined the league .
Bondurant–Farrar joined the Raccoon River Conference in the 2011–12 school year . Dallas Center-Grimes , one of the league 's founding members , left for the Little Hawkeye Conference in 2013 .
Gilbert and North Polk both joined for the 2020–21 school year . They left their former conference , the Heart of Iowa Conference .

Lyrics
Hunting The Hun
Over in France there 's a game that 's played
By all the soldier boys in each brigade
It 's called Hunting the Hun
This is how it is done !
First you go get a gun
Then you look for a Hun
Then you start on the run for the son of a gun
You can capture them with ease
All you need is just a little Limburger cheese
Give 'em one little smell
They come out with a yell
Then your work is done
When they start to advance
Shoot 'em in the pants
That 's the game called Hunting the Hun !
First you go get a gun
Then you look for a Hun
Then you start on the run for the son of a gun
You can capture them with ease
All you need is just a little Limburger cheese
Give 'em one little smell
They come out with a yell
Then your work is done
When they start to advance
Shoot 'em in the pants
That 's the game called Hunting the Hun !
I met a soldier and he told me
It 's just the latest thing across the sea
It 's the game that is new
They 're all doing it too !
First you go get a gun
Then you look for a Hun
Then you start on the run for the son of a gun
You can capture them with ease
All you need is just a little Limburger cheese
Give 'em one little smell
They come out with a yell
Then your work is done
When they start to advance
Shoot 'em in the pants
That 's the game called Hunting the Hun !
First you go get a gun
Then you look for a Hun
Then you start on the run for the son of a gun
If you want to bring them out
Offer them a little bit of hot sauerkraut
They come over the top with a pip and a hop
Then your work is done
When they stop in to eat
Cut off their retreat
That 's the game called Hunting the Hun !
First you go get a gun
Then you look for a Hun
Then you start on the run for the son of a gun
You can always make them pain
Let them know there 's going to be a pinochle game
They come over the top with a pip and a hop
Then your work is done
When they first show their face
Crump 'em with a mace
That 's the game called Hunting the Hun ! ''

( singular : oraculum vivæ vocis ) is a Latin term of Catholic canon law that refers to decisions of the pope or heads of the dicasteries that are made verbally . Literally the Latin refers to an `` oracular out-voice , '' or an utterance of an oracle . They are immediately binding within the respective organizations to which they are directed , but are only binding externally after their existence has been proven .

United Recording Electronics Industries ( UREI ) was a manufacturer of recording , mixing and audio signal processing hardware for the professional recording studio , live sound and broadcasting fields .
History
Bill Putnam Sr. founded Universal Audio in Chicago in the 1950s as a design and manufacturing addition to his recording studio business , Universal Recording Corporation . After Putnam moved to Hollywood in 1957 and established the United Recording Corporation , his company acquired Studio Supply Co. and rebranded it as the Studio Electronics Corporation ( SEC ) and moved all manufacturing to the second floor of Western Recorders . By December , 1965 , Universal Audio had been completely absorbed by Studio Electronics , although Studio Electronics continued to produce some Universal Audio-branded products .
In 1967 , Studio Electronics acquired the broadcast division of Babcock Electronics , including Teletronix and the patent rights to the electro-optical LA-2A leveling amplifier . In anticipation of further acquisitions , SEC was rebranded as United Recording Electronics Industries , or UREI .
UREI subsequently acquired National Intertel ; from this acquisition came technology which developed into the 1176 peak limiter in 1968 , and the 1108 FET preamp . Other notable products included the UREI Teletronix LA-3A electro-optical leveling amplifier , LA-4 electro-optical compressor limiter , and UREI 500-series graphic equalizers . By 1976 , UREI had moved their manufacturing and service center to Sun Valley , California .
UREI collaborated with Edward M. Long of E.M. Long Associates in Oakland , California to create the 813 family of time-aligned large-format studio monitor speakers , introduced in 1977 . The 813 and subsequent models introduced in 1979 , including the 813A , 815A , and 811A , used Altec Lansing and Eminence drivers . In 1983 , financial and quality control problems at Altec led UREI to introduce the 813B , which utilized JBL loudspeaker drivers .
Putnam sold UREI to Harman in 1983 , and UREI became a division of JBL Professional . Harman began releasing `` JBL-UREI '' co-branded products such as the 5547A graphic equalizer in 1986 .
In 2005 , another Harman division , Soundcraft , introduced a `` UREI-by-Soundcraft '' -badged 1620LE mixer , with 'LE ' standing for 'Limited Edition ' . The mixer was a re-issue of the UREI 1620 , a 1980s-era clone of Rudy Bozak 's classic 1960s-era rotary-style DJ mixer , the CMA-10-2DL . Soundcraft provided the new product line with its own website .

Background
During the 1990s the Turing Institute had been involved in a wide range of robotics activities and had developed links with many leading robotics laboratories as a result of both student exchange and a series of collaborative research projects .
The event was conceived and directed by Dr Peter Mowforth , director of the Turing Institute , as an events-based meetup for robot enthusiasts and builders . Although there had been single event competitions and national events for competing robots , this was the first time that such a large , varied and international Robot Competition had taken place .
Many of the robots that came to the event reflected key research themes that were present at the time . For example , the two-wheeled balancing 'torch carrying ' ( pre-Segway ) robot that opened the event was associated with the institute 's work on using machine learning applied to the inverted pendulum
Strathclyde University was an academic associate of and adjacent to the Turing Institute . The university made their sports hall complex available for the two-day event .

Sir Henry Lello was an English diplomat , Warden of the Fleet Prison , and Keeper of the Palace of Westminster .
Lello went to Constantinople as an attache to the English Embassy to the Sublime Porte of the Ottoman Empire , but originally as secretary to Edward Barton . In 1597 he took his place as ambassador .
As ambassador he was less popular in the court than his predecessors William Harborne and Sir Edward Barton and was less comfortable also , at one point stating that he was shocked by the extent of the violence and intrigue in the court of Mehmed III and his mother Safiye Sultan , and in 1607 complaining that bribery was so widespread that the economy was now driven by the level of corruption and that neither religious nor civil law had any place in it . He left Constantinople on 24 May 1607 .
He began his term as ambassador by arranging the donation of an elaborate organ-clock commissioned by the queen Elizabeth I and built by organ-maker Thomas Dallam . The gift was intended to outshine overtures being made to the Sultan by Germany , France and other European nations in pursuit of trading rights in Ottoman territory .

Reginald Augustine 'Whip ' Latta ( 1897–1970 ) was an Australian professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1910s and 1920s who also became a coach . An Australia national and New South Wales state representative forward , he played his club football in Sydney for the Balmain club , with whom he won five premierships . Latta also coached the team .
Background
Latta was born in Balmain , New South Wales to parent James and Mary Latta in 1897 .
Playing career
He came through the junior ranks to debut for Balmain in 1916 as a 19-year-old . He went on to play fourteen first grade seasons with Balmain between 1916–1930 . He was a blonde haired lock-forward and he was known by the nickname 'Whip ' . He won five premierships with Balmain in 1916 , 1917 , 1919 , 1920 and 1924 . He represented New South Wales on eleven occasions during : 1921 , 1923 , 1924 and 1925 . He also represented Australia on five occasions including touring with the 1921-22 Kangaroos as was named the Champion Australian Player of that tour . He was also the first Balmain player to play more than 200 games for the club .
Post-playing
Latta would coach Balmain in 1929 and 1931 .
Family
Reg Latta 's older brother Alfred played in the First Rugby League match in 1908 scoring the first try and kicking the first goal when Balmain defeated Western Suburbs . Alfred Latta played for Balmain 1908–12 , he then became Club Secretary , and from 1916 served on the League committee , ( executive ) , as a NSW Selector , then Australian Selector . Alfred also held the position of NSWRFL Vice President when he died in 1947 . Alfred Latta had three sons , Jack who was graded as a referee at age 22 , Alfred Junior also a referee , mainly 2nd grade and 1st grade touch judge , his other son Ernie played first grade for Balmain as halfback and fullback . Reg Latta 's other brother Harry also played first grade for Balmain . There were six members of the Latta family involved in Rugby League prior to 1940 and they are often confused .
The following appears in the original quote I believe it should refer to Alfred Latta and not Reg Latta . `` also served Balmain as a committeeman and office-holder for many years . He was awarded Life Membership of the NSWRFL in 1937 for services to the game . ''
Death
Latta died on 30 July 1970 at his Drummoyne home aged 73 .

Hazim Tahsin Said ( born 1 May 1963 in Ba'adre ) is the current and official Mir ( Prince ) of the Yezidis since July 27 , 2019 . Mir Hazim is the son and successor of Tahseen Beg , who after ruling Yezidis for 75 years , died at the age of 85 . Mir Hazim has previously won a seat in the Kurdistan Region parliament , running as a Kurdistan Democratic Party candidate in 2009 . He is married to Mayan Khairi Saeed , has two sons and a daughter . He holds a bachelor 's degree in agriculture at the University of Baghdad .
Controversy on the Mir position
The choosing of Mir Hazim by the Spiritual Council in Lalish led to a lot of criticism by some Yezidis , he was accused of having been chosen by KDP authorities to lead Yezidis and not by the Yezidi community itself , in addition , his mother is not of princely family background , thus leading many to believe that he is not a legitimate successor . As a result , some Yezidi notables , tribal leaders and factions with opposing affiliations , namely the PKK-affiliated YBŞ , recognized Naif Bin Dawud as the new Mir in Shingal . However , YBŞ commanders denied that he was affiliated with PKK , instead , claiming that he was neutral .

Paul Bauer ( 29 December 1896 – 9 January 1990 ) was a German poet and mountaineer .
Biography
Bauer was born at Kusel in the Palatinate region of Germany . As a schoolboy , he first visited the Alps on a cycling tour through the Dolomites via Bolzano and Merano to Lake Constance . He saw active service in the First World War and spent the end of that war as a prisoner in England . His interest in climbing continued as he studied law in Munich . Travelling on a tight budget with friends he tackled many of the classic climbs in central Europe . In 1928 he visited the Caucasus with three friends , where they climbed to the summit of Dykh-Tau – second highest peak in Europe .
In 1929 he led a team of nine German Mountaineers in a first attempt on Kangchenjunga . They equipped themselves well , but were turned back by poor weather and bad conditions having reached 26,000 feet . Returning in 1931 , Bauer 's team were again rebuffed by the sheer size and scale of the Mountain . It was during this second attempt on Kangchenjunga , that Hermann Schaller lost his life . In 1932 Bauer won a gold medal in the art competitions of the Olympic Games for his `` Am Kangehenzonga '' , an account of his 1931 attempt to climb the Himalayan peak Kangchenjunga .
Following two failed attempts Bauer found it difficult to raise funds for a third attempt ; the German public 's attention now turned to Nanga Parbat . After the disastrous 1934 expedition , Bauer headed up a training climb in 1936 which found success on Siniolchu . His ventures led to prominent positions in German mountain climbing organizations during the Nazi era . One of his objectives during that time was to eliminate Jews from these organizations . During World War II , Bauer was an officer in the Gebirgsjäger , a regiment of specially trained Alpine Troops . He describes his return to the Caucasus as not what he had expected – at the head of two thousand troops in 1943 .

Giuseppe Campani ( 1635–July 28 , 1715 ) was an Italian optician and astronomer who lived in Rome during the latter half of the 17th century .
Life
Giuseppe Campani was born in 1635 .
He was an Umbrian from Castel San Felice near Spoleto .
His lenses and telescopes , made in Rome , were sent as far as Florence and Paris .
Campani was known as the best maker of optical instruments of his age .
His brother , Matteo Campani-Alimenis , and he were experts in grinding and polishing lenses , especially for very long focal length aerial telescope objectives .
His brother is also noted as a mechanician for his work on clocks . He was a priest in charge of a parish in Rome .
Louis XIV of France ordered several long-focus lenses ( 86 , 100 , 136 feet respectively ) for the astronomer Giovanni Domenico Cassini .
With these Cassini found several moons of the planet Saturn , among other discoveries .
Constantijn Huygens , Jr. , brother of Christiaan Huygens , acquired one of Campani 's telescopes .
While in London in 1689 he ordered a new tube for the instrument from the instrument maker John Marshall .
Astronomer
Campani made many observations himself . Cassini called his attention to the spots on Jupiter , and he disputed with Eustachio Divini , an Italian optician , the priority of their discovery . His astronomical observations and his descriptions of his telescopes are detailed in the following papers : Ragguaglio di due nuovi osservazioni , una celeste in ordine alla stella di Saturno , e terrestre l'altra in ordine agl ' instrumenti ( Rome , 1664 , and again in 1665 ) ; Lettere di G. C. al sig . Giovanni Domenico Cassini intorno alle ombre delle stelle Medicee nel volto di Giove , ed altri nuovi fenomeni celesti scoperti co ' suoi occhiali ( Rome , 1666 ) .
Instruments
Campani 's entire workshop was donated to the Gabinetto di Fisica of the Academy of Sciences of Bologna Institute in 1747 .
His telescopes were in length .
A telescope by Campani was tested in 1871 and was found to provide good definition and a flat field , with a magnification of about 20 times .
A tripod compound monocular microscope made by Campani is held in the Billings microscope collection at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington , D.C .

`` World of Our Love '' is a song written by Australian group Client Liaison and co-produced with Flight Facilities . It was released on 19 April 2016 as the lead single from their debut studio album , Diplomatic Immunity ( 2016 ) . The single was certified gold in Australia in 2018 .
Reception
`` World of Our Love '' peaked at No . 11 on the ARIA Hitseekers Singles chart ; it was certified gold , for shipment of 35000 copies , by Australian Recording Industry Association ( ARIA ) in January 2018 .
Sosefina Fuamoli from The Music AU observed , `` With some well timed saxophone blending in with the shimmery and uber-danceable beat , 'World of Our Love ' is inviting , fun and excellently executed . ''
Music video
The song 's music video was directed by Mike Greaney and Aaron McDonald , which was released on 11 May 2016 .
The animated music video was made in collaboration with Oh Yeah Wow and is a tribute to the opulence of Australian life and culture . Greaney and McDonald described how , `` It 's an absurdist pastiche of cultist and Australiana iconography , retro-future architecture , and exotic wild animals . We packaged these ideas up in a visual style that was heavily inspired by late 80s Masters of the Universe cartoons and then basically just had a blast coming up with the most outrageous ideas we could think of within that frame work .

The white-eared jacamar ( Galbalcyrhynchus leucotis ) is a species of bird in the family Galbulidae . It is found in Brazil , Colombia , Ecuador and Peru .
Taxonomy and systematics
The white-eared jacamar shares genus Galbalcyrhynchus with the purus jacamar ( G. purusianus ) . They were originally treated a separate species , then as conspecific ( `` chestnut jacamar '' ) , but are now understood to be separate species . The white-eared jacamar is monotypic .
Description
The white-eared jacamar is long and weighs . It is stouter than many jacamars , and has a more robust bill . It is almost entirely reddish-chestnut , with a bronzy gloss on the crown , wings , and tail . It has large white ear coverts . The juvenile is paler and its bill is shorter .
Distribution and habitat
The white-eared jacamar is found in the upper Amazon basin from Meta Department in central Colombia south through eastern Ecuador to the Ucayali River in northeastern Peru . It extends east into western Brazil along the Solimões ( Upper Amazon ) River almost to Manaus . In this humid region , it inhabits terra firme and várzea forest , both primary and secondary . It prefers edges such as around clearings and along waterways . In elevation it ranges up to .
Behavior
Feeding
The white-eared jacamar preys on insects , with Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera favored . It perches at mid- to upper canopy height singly or in small groups and sallies out to capture its prey .
Breeding
White-eared jacamar nest cavities in Ecuador and Peru were in termite nests high in trees . The Ecuador nest was active in April and that in Peru in July . Breeding condition birds were recorded in June in Colombia .
Vocalization
The white-eared jacamar 's song has been described as a `` rising and accelerating ... trill , “ trrreeeeeeerrrr-reeeerrr-reeerr-reerreerr ... ” . It also makes a loud `` kyew '' or `` cue '' call .
Status
The IUCN has assessed the white-eared jacamar as being of The Least Concern . It is generally common in its large range and occurs in several protected areas . With ongoing deforestation in Amazonia , its `` preference for successional and edge habitats suggests good survival prospects . ''

Ursus is a district ( dzielnica ) of Warsaw , one of the 18 such units into which the city is divided . Between 1952 and 1977 it was a separate city . Until 1954 it was known as Czechowice .
History
In the area that is today Ursus , there were three villages in the 14th century : Czechowice , Skorosze and Szamoty ( later called Gołąbki ) .
Industrialisation in the 20th century contributed to developing these villages . Skorosze became the seat of the municipality , and in the early 1920s the Szamoty area 's Zakłady Mechaniczne `` Ursus '' ( ) ( makers of agricultural machinery ) were built . Czechowice became a housing estate due to it being in the vicinity of factories . In the 1939 , before World War II , it had 7000 inhabitants . Skorosze had a school , police station and train station in its area .
In 1952 Czechowice , Skorosze and Szamoty were combined into one city , called Czechowice , which in 1954 changed its name to Ursus ( there had been another Czechowice-Dziedzice city already , located in southern Poland ) .
From June 25 to June 30 , 1976 , the city of Ursus witnessed strikes after the communists raised food prices . Many people got injured and arrested . It was the signal that started Komitet Obrony Robotników ( KOR ) , a movement which was successful in uniting the workers and intellectuals against the communist government , which eventually led to the birth of the Solidarity movement .
On August 1 , 1977 , Ursus became part of Warsaw within the Ochota district as punishment for the strikes in June 1976 . Ursus lost its independence as a separate city .
Since January 1 , 1993 Ursus has been a separate district .
The present
Ursus is one of the smallest Warsaw districts . It also has the lowest crime rate .

Mary Katharine Gaillard ( born April 1 , 1939 ) is an American theoretical physicist . Her focus is on particle physics . She is a professor of the Graduate School at the University of California , Berkeley , a member of the Berkeley Center for Theoretical Physics , and Visiting Scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory . She was Berkeley 's first tenured female physicist .
Her important contributions include prediction of the mass of the charm quark prior to its discovery ( with B. W. Lee ) ; prediction of 3-jet events ( with J. Ellis and G.G . Ross ) ; and prediction of b-quark mass ( with M.S . Chanowitz and J. Ellis ) . Gaillard 's autobiography is A Singularly Unfeminine Profession , published in 2015 by World Scientific .
Early life
Mary Katharine Ralph was born April 1 , 1939 in New Brunswick , New Jersey , and grew up in Painesville , Ohio , where her father taught history at Lake Erie College .
She attended Hollins College in Virginia as an undergraduate . Her physics professor , Dorothy Montgomery , helped her to find work in the Louis Leprince-Ringuet laboratory in France during a year abroad , and at Brookhaven National Labs in the summer . She received her bachelor 's degree from Hollins in 1960 . She received her master 's degree from Columbia University in 1961 .
At the end of her first year at Columbia she married Jean-Marc Gaillard , a visiting physics postdoctoral student . She moved with him , first to the University of Paris at Orsay , France and a year later to the European Organization for Nuclear Research ( CERN ) in Geneva , Switzerland . Despite experiencing sexism and having three children , she continued to study theoretical physics . In 1964 she obtained her Doctorat du Troisième Cycle from the University of Paris at Orsay , France . In 1968 , she completed her Doctorat d'Etat in Theoretical Physics there .
Career
During her time at CERN ( 1964-1981 ) Gaillard was considered a visiting scientist , first as a student from Orsay , and later as a research scientist employed by the French National Centre for Scientific Research ( CNRS ) . At one point , she carried out and submitted a survey of women scientists at CERN , documenting clear patterns of blatant sexism against women scientists in hiring and salaries .
Nonetheless , her scientific achievements at CERN led to her advancement at CNRS .
In 1979 Gaillard established a particle theory group at the Laboratoire d'Annecy-le-Vieux de physique des particules ( LAPP ) , Annecy-le-Vieux , France . She directed the group from 1979 to 1981 . She served as Director of Research at Annecy-le-Vieux for the CNRS from 1980-1981 . In 1981 , the Gaillards divorced , and she returned to the United States .
Gaillard joined the physics department at the Berkeley in 1981 , becoming the first woman Professor of Physics . She was concurrently a Faculty Senior Staff member at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory ( LBNL ) , where she headed the Theory Group from 1985 to 1987 .
Gaillard served on several committees of the American Physical Society , advisory panels for the Department of Energy and the United States National Research Council , and on advisory and visiting committees at universities and national laboratories . She was a member of the National Science Board from 1996 to 2002 .
Research
Her research accomplishments include pioneering work with Benjamin W. Lee on the evaluation of strong interaction corrections to weak transitions , including the successful prediction of the mass of the charm quark ; work with John Ellis and others on the analysis of final states in electron-positron collisions , including the prediction of Three-jet events , and studies of unified gauge theories , including the prediction of the bottom quark mass ; studies with Michael Chanowitz of signatures at proton-proton colliders which showed , on very general grounds , that new physics must show up at sufficiently high energies . Her later work focused on effective supergravity theories based on superstrings , and their implications for phenomena that may be detected both in accelerator experiments and cosmological observations .

Where the Red Fern Grows is a 1974 drama film directed by Norman Tokar and starring James Whitmore , Beverly Garland , Stewart Petersen and Jack Ging . It is based on the 1961 novel of the same name .
Plot
Twelve-year-old Billy Coleman is obsessed with coon dogs and coon hunting , but good dogs cost money that his family can not afford . However , he sees several good dogs belonging to others , including a man named Mr. Kyle . One day Billy 's father mentions that there 's a Bluetick pup for sale at his grandpa 's store . Billy runs to see it , only to have the Pritchard boys talk their father into buying it just to spite Billy . Billy 's grandpa tells him that if he wants dogs he has to earn them . He begins working multiple jobs and finally earns the fifty dollars two puppies will cost . By that time , the price has dropped by five dollars each . Billy orders the dogs , but they arrive in Tahlequah , 30 miles away , because the mail stage wo n't carry live animals . Billy sneaks out of the house in the night and travels to Tahlequah . He uses his leftover ten dollars to buy presents for his family ; overalls for Papa , dress cloth for Mama and candy for his younger sisters . Billy picks up the pups at the depot and carries them home in a gunny sack . He has to stop overnight and encounters a cougar which snarls at him until he makes a fire to scare it off .
The next day Billy passes a tree with the names Dan and Ann carved inside a heart on the trunk . He names the female puppy Little Ann and the male Old Dan . Once Billy gets the puppies home he sets out to train them to be the best dogs in the Ozarks , using a coonskin to teach them to scent trail . On the night of Billy 's first hunt , the dogs go after a coon almost immediately but the coon foils them by crossing the river . Billy catches up with the dogs and tells them he is ashamed of them . He forces them to swim the river and pick up the track on the other bank . The dogs tree the coon up an enormous tree , and Billy starts trying to chop it down with his small hatchet even though it seems impossible . Finally he calls on God to help him and a strong wind blows the tree over . Billy 's dogs become famous in that part of the country . One day , he runs into the Pritchard boys again down at Grandpa 's store . They tell him about a ghost coon that runs on their land and which no dog has ever been able to tree . They then antagonize Billy until he bets them that Dan and Ann can tree the ghost coon . On the hunt , Dan and Ann tree the coon in an old mill . Billy refuses to kill it , saying it deserves to live because it fooled every dog in the country . He and the Pritchards get into a fight . At the same time , the Pritchard dog , Old Blue , gets loose and begins fighting Dan and Ann . Ruben Pritchard pulls Billy 's hatchet out of his belt and runs toward the dogs . Billy trips him , and Ruben falls on the hatchet and dies . After Ruben 's funeral , Billy tells his family he is never going hunting again . A few days later , Grandpa invites the whole family over to Sunday dinner . At the dinner , he tells them about a championship coonhunt that will be held soon and convinces Billy to enter . At the coonhunt , Billy wins the right to hunt in the championship round , along with two other hunters , one of whom is Mr. Kyle and his pair of Treeing Walker Coonhounds .
On the final night of the coonhunt , a blizzard blows up . Dan and Ann tree one coon and are on the way to another one when Grandpa trips and sprains his ankle . Nobody notices as they chase after the dogs . Dan and Ann have three raccoons up a single tree . Just then , Billy notices that Grandpa is missing . He calls the dogs off the coons , even though Papa tells him it 's impossible , and sends them to find Grandpa and they succeed . The next day is the awards ceremony . Mr. Kyle is given the prize , but he gives it to Billy instead , saying that he earned it but not to get too cocky because he and his Walkers were going to whip Billy and his Redbones next year . Not long after the championship hunt , Billy is out hunting with Dan and Ann when they start barking up a cliff . A mountain lion jumps off and the dogs attack him before he can get to Billy . During the fight , Billy manages to get out his hatchet and kill the lion , but not before it mortally injures Old Dan . Billy carries Dan home but he dies . They bury him down by the river . After Dan 's death , Little Ann loses the will to live and dies on his grave a couple of weeks later . Billy buries her beside him . Billy 's parents decide to use the prize money from the coonhunt to move the whole family to Tulsa to operate a store . On the day they are leaving , Billy walks down by the river to Dan and Ann 's graves . A red fern , which according to American Indian legend can only be planted by an angel , is growing between the two and Billy calls the family down to see it . Seeing the red fern satisfies Billy that what happened is for the best and he goes to Tulsa with his family .

Maahes ( also spelled in Greek : Mihos , Miysis , Mios , Maihes , or Mahes ) ( Greek : Μαχές , Μιχός , Μίυσις , Μίος , or Μάιχες ) was an ancient Egyptian lion-headed god of war , whose name means `` he who is true beside her '' . He was seen as the son of the Creator god Ptah , as well as the feline goddess ( Bast in Lower Egypt or Sekhmet in Upper Egypt ) whose nature he shared . Maahes was a deity associated with war , protection , and weather , as well as that of knives , lotuses , and devouring captives . His cult was centred in Taremu and Per-Bast , the cult centres of Sekhmet and Bast respectively .
Name
The name of Maahes begins with the hieroglyphs for the male lion , although in isolation it also means ( one who can ) see in front . Some of the titles of Maahes were Lord of Slaughter , Wielder of the Knife , and The Scarlet Lord .
Origin
The first recorded reference to Maahes is from the New Kingdom . Some Egyptologists have suggested that Maahes was of foreign origin ; indeed there is some evidence that he may have been identical with the lion-god Apedemak worshipped in Nubia and Egypt 's Western Desert .
Maahes was considered the son of Ra with the feline goddess Bastet , or of another feline goddess , Sekhmet . He was sometimes identified with another son of Sekhmet , Nefertum . Maahes was said to fight Ra 's archenemy , the serpent Apep , during Ra 's nightly voyage .
Considered to have powerful attributes , feline deities were associated with the pharaohs , and became patrons of Egypt . The male lion hieroglyphic was used in words such as `` prince '' , `` mashead '' , `` strength '' , and `` power '' .
Depictions
Maahes was pictured as a man with the head of a male lion , sometimes holding a knife and a bouquet of lotus flowers , referring to his connection with Nefertum , who was symbolized by the lotus .
Sacred animals
Tame lions were kept in a temple dedicated to Maahes in Taremu , where Bast/Sekhmet were worshipped , his temple was adjacent to that of Bast . The ancient Greek historian Aelian wrote : `` In Egypt , they worship lions , and there is a city called after them . ( ... ) The lions have temples and numerous spaces in which to roam ; the flesh of oxen is supplied to them daily ( ... ) and the lions eat to the accompaniment of song in the Egyptian language '' , thus the Greek name of the city Leontopolis was derived .

Wireless Application Protocol ( WAP ) is a technical standard for accessing information over a mobile wireless network . A WAP browser is a web browser for mobile devices such as mobile phones that use the protocol . Introduced in 1999 , WAP achieved some popularity in the early 2000s , but by the 2010s it had been largely superseded by more modern standards . Almost all modern handset internet browsers now fully support HTML , so they do not need to use WAP markup for web page compatibility , and therefore , most are no longer able to render and display pages written in WML , WAP 's markup language .
Before the introduction of WAP , mobile service providers had limited opportunities to offer interactive data services , but needed interactivity to support Internet and Web applications such as email , stock prices , news and sports headlines . The Japanese i-mode system offered another major competing wireless data protocol .
Technical specifications
WAP stack
The WAP standard described a protocol suite or stack allowing the interoperability of WAP equipment and software with different network technologies , such as GSM and IS-95 ( also known as CDMA ) .
The bottom-most protocol in the suite , the Wireless Datagram Protocol ( WDP ) , functions as an adaptation layer that makes every data network look a bit like UDP to the upper layers by providing unreliable transport of data with two 16-bit port numbers ( origin and destination ) . All the upper layers view WDP as one and the same protocol , which has several `` technical realizations '' on top of other `` data bearers '' such as SMS , USSD , etc . On native IP bearers such as GPRS , UMTS packet-radio service , or PPP on top of a circuit-switched data connection , WDP is in fact exactly UDP .
WTLS , an optional layer , provides a public-key cryptography-based security mechanism similar to TLS .
WTP provides transaction support ( reliable request/response ) adapted to the wireless world . WTP supports more effectively than TCP the problem of packet loss , which occurs commonly in 2G wireless technologies in most radio conditions , but is misinterpreted by TCP as network congestion .
This protocol suite allows a terminal to transmit requests that have an HTTP or HTTPS equivalent to a WAP gateway ; the gateway translates requests into plain HTTP .
The Wireless Application Environment ( WAE ) space defines application-specific markup languages .
For WAP version 1.X , the primary language of the WAE is Wireless Markup Language ( WML ) . In WAP 2.0 , the primary markup language is XHTML Mobile Profile .
WAP Push
WAP Push was incorporated into the specification to allow the WAP content to be pushed to the mobile handset with minimal user intervention . A WAP Push is basically a specially encoded message which includes a link to a WAP address .
WAP Push was specified on top of Wireless Datagram Protocol ( WDP ) ; as such , it can be delivered over any WDP-supported bearer , such as GPRS or SMS . Most GSM networks have a wide range of modified processors , but GPRS activation from the network is not generally supported , so WAP Push messages have to be delivered on top of the SMS bearer .
On receiving a WAP Push , a WAP 1.2 ( or later ) -enabled handset will automatically give the user the option to access the WAP content . This is also known as WAP Push SI ( Service Indication ) . A variant , known as WAP Push SL ( Service Loading ) , directly opens the browser to display the WAP content , without user interaction . Since this behaviour raises security concerns , some handsets handle WAP Push SL messages in the same way as SI , by providing user interaction .
The network entity that processes WAP Pushes and delivers them over an IP or SMS Bearer is known as a Push Proxy Gateway ( PPG ) .
WAP 2.0
A re-engineered 2.0 version was released in 2002 . It uses a cut-down version of XHTML with end-to-end HTTP , dropping the gateway and custom protocol suite used to communicate with it . A WAP gateway can be used in conjunction with WAP 2.0 ; however , in this scenario , it is used as a standard proxy server . The WAP gateway 's role would then shift from one of translation to adding additional information to each request . This would be configured by the operator and could include telephone numbers , location , billing information , and handset information .
Mobile devices process XHTML Mobile Profile ( XHTML MP ) , the markup language defined in WAP 2.0 . It is a subset of XHTML and a superset of XHTML Basic . A version of Cascading Style Sheets ( CSS ) called WAP CSS is supported by XHTML MP .
MMS
Multimedia Messaging Service ( MMS ) is a combination of WAP and SMS allowing for sending of picture messages .
History
The WAP Forum was founded in 1998 by Ericsson , Motorola , Nokia and Unwired Planet . It aimed primarily to bring together the various wireless technologies in a standardised protocol . In 2002 , the WAP Forum was consolidated ( along with many other forums of the industry ) into Open Mobile Alliance ( OMA ) .
Europe
The first company to launch a WAP site was Dutch mobile phone operator Telfort BV in October 1999 . The site was developed as a side project by Christopher Bee and Euan McLeod and launched with the debut of the Nokia 7110 . Marketers hyped WAP at the time of its introduction , leading users to expect WAP to have the performance of fixed ( non-mobile ) Internet access . BT Cellnet , one of the UK telecoms , ran an advertising campaign depicting a cartoon WAP user surfing through a Neuromancer-like `` information space '' . In terms of speed , ease of use , appearance and interoperability , the reality fell far short of expectations when the first handsets became available in 1999 . This led to the wide usage of sardonic phrases such as `` Worthless Application Protocol '' , `` Wait And Pay '' , and WAPlash .
Between 2003 and 2004 WAP made a stronger resurgence with the introduction of wireless services ( such as Vodafone Live ! , T-Mobile T-Zones and other easily accessible services ) . Operator revenues were generated by transfer of GPRS and UMTS data , which is a different business model than used by the traditional Web sites and ISPs . According to the Mobile Data Association , WAP traffic in the UK doubled from 2003 to 2004 .
By the year 2013 , WAP use had largely disappeared . Most major companies and websites have since retired from the use of WAP and it has not been a mainstream technology for web on mobile for a number of years .
Most modern handset internet browsers now support full HTML , CSS , and most of JavaScript , and do not need to use any kind of WAP markup for webpage compatibility . The list of handsets supporting HTML is extensive , and includes all Android handsets , all versions of the iPhone handset , all Blackberry devices , all devices running Windows Phone , and many Nokia handsets .
Asia
WAP saw major success in Japan . While the largest operator NTT DoCoMo did not use WAP in favor of its in-house system i-mode , rival operators KDDI ( au ) and SoftBank Mobile ( previously Vodafone Japan ) both successfully deployed WAP technology . In particular , ( au ) 's chakuuta or chakumovie ( ringtone song or ringtone movie ) services were based on WAP . Like in Europe , WAP and i-mode usage declined in the 2010s as HTML-capable smartphones became popular in Japan .
United States
Adoption of WAP in the US suffered because many cell phone providers required separate activation and additional fees for data support , and also because telecommunications companies sought to limit data access to only approved data providers operating under license of the signal carrier .
In recognition of the problem , the US Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) issued an order on 31 July 2007 which mandated that licensees of the 22-megahertz wide `` Upper 700 MHz C Block '' spectrum would have to implement a wireless platform which allows customers , device manufacturers , third-party application developers , and others to use any device or application of their choice when operating on this particular licensed network band .
Criticism
Commentators criticized several aspects of Wireless Markup Language ( WML ) and WAP . Technical criticisms include :
The idiosyncratic WML language : WML cut users off from the conventional HTML Web , leaving only native WAP content and Web-to-WAP proxi-content available to WAP users . However , others argue that technology at that stage would simply not have been able to give access to anything but custom-designed content which was the sole purpose of WAP and its simple , reduced complexity interface as the citizens of many nations are not connected to the web at the present time and have to use government funded and controlled portals to WAP and similar non-complex services .
Under-specification of terminal requirements : The early WAP standards included many optional features and under-specified requirements , which meant that compliant devices would not necessarily interoperate properly . This resulted in great variability in the actual behavior of phones , principally because WAP-service implementers and mobile-phone manufacturers did not obtain a copy of the standards or the correct hardware and the standard software modules . As an example , some phone models would not accept a page more than 1 Kb in size , and some would even crash . The user interface of devices was also underspecified : as an example , accesskeys ( e.g. , the ability to press ' 4 ' to access directly the fourth link in a list ) were variously implemented depending on phone models ( sometimes with the accesskey number automatically displayed by the browser next to the link , sometimes without it , and sometimes accesskeys were not implemented at all ) .
Constrained user interface capabilities : Terminals with small black-and-white screens and few buttons , like the early WAP terminals , face difficulties in presenting a lot of information to their user , which compounded the other problems : one would have had to be extra careful in designing the user interface on such a resource-constrained device which was the real concept of WAP .
Lack of good authoring tools : The problems above might have succumbed in the face of a WML authoring tool that would have allowed content providers to easily publish content that would interoperate flawlessly with many models , adapting the pages presented to the User-Agent type . However , the development kits which existed did not provide such a general capability . Developing for the web was easy : with a text editor and a web browser , anybody could get started , thanks also to the forgiving nature of most desktop browser rendering engines . By contrast , the stringent requirements of the WML specifications , the variability in terminals , and the demands of testing on various wireless terminals , along with the lack of widely available desktop authoring and emulation tools , considerably lengthened the time required to complete most projects . , however , with many mobile devices supporting XHTML , and programs such as Adobe Go Live and Dreamweaver offering improved web-authoring tools , it is becoming easier to create content , accessible by many new devices .
Lack of user agent profiling tools : It quickly became nearly impossible for web hosts to determine if a request came from a mobile device , or from a larger more capable device . No useful profiling or database of device capabilities were built into the specifications in the unauthorized non-compliant products .
Other criticisms address the wireless carriers ' particular implementations of WAP :
Neglect of content providers : Some wireless carriers had assumed a `` build it and they will come '' strategy , meaning that they would just provide the transport of data as well as the terminals , and then wait for content providers to publish their services on the Internet and make their investment in WAP useful . However , content providers received little help or incentive to go through the complicated route of development . Others , notably in Japan ( cf . below ) , had a more thorough dialogue with their content-provider community , which was then replicated in modern , more successful WAP services such as i-mode in Japan or the Gallery service in France .
Lack of openness : Many wireless carriers sold their WAP services as `` open '' , in that they allowed users to reach any service expressed in WML and published on the Internet . However , they also made sure that the first page that clients accessed was their own `` wireless portal '' , which they controlled very closely . Some carriers also turned off editing or accessing the address bar in the device 's browser . To facilitate users wanting to go off deck , an address bar on a form on a page linked off the hard coded home page was provided . It makes it easier for carriers to implement filtering of off deck WML sites by URLs or to disable the address bar in the future if the carrier decides to switch all users to a walled garden model . Given the difficulty in typing up fully qualified URLs on a phone keyboard , most users would give up going `` off portal '' or out of the walled garden ; by not letting third parties put their own entries on the operators ' wireless portal , some contend that operators cut themselves off from a valuable opportunity . On the other hand , some operators argue that their customers would have wanted them to manage the experience and , on such a constrained device , avoid giving access to too many services .
Protocol design lessons from WAP
The original WAP model provided a simple platform for access to web-like WML services and e-mail using mobile phones in Europe and the SE Asian regions . In 2009 it continued to have a considerable user base . The later versions of WAP , primarily targeting the United States market , were designed for a different requirement - to enable full web XHTML access using mobile devices with a higher specification and cost , and with a higher degree of software complexity .
Considerable discussion has addressed the question whether the WAP protocol design was appropriate .
The initial design of WAP specifically aimed at protocol independence across a range of different protocols ( SMS , IP over PPP over a circuit switched bearer , IP over GPRS , etc. ) . This has led to a protocol considerably more complex than an approach directly over IP might have caused .
Most controversial , especially for many from the IP side , was the design of WAP over IP . WAP 's transmission layer protocol , WTP , uses its own retransmission mechanisms over UDP to attempt to solve the problem of the inadequacy of TCP over high-packet-loss networks .

Sierra is a Canadian progressive metal band formed in Kitchener-Waterloo , Ontario . Their music fuses elements of progressive rock , heavy metal , and instrumental music . Sierra have been touring since 2012 , opening for bands such as Weedeater , The Obsessed , Kylesa , Unsane , and Karma to Burn .
The band was formed by Jason Taylor and Robbie Carvalho who have been playing together since they were kids . They met after Jason posted an ad in a music store looking for young musicians into 1970s progressive rock . Jason was 15 and Robbie was 12 at the time .
Their first album , Pslip , was the first release on the Kylesa operated record label Retro Futurist Records . The album , as with all of their albums since , was recorded at The Jam Room Studios in North Carolina , by Phillip Cope of Kylesa .
The band signed to Tone Deaf Touring after the release of Pslip and have been on the road consistently since . Their first tour was across North America with Kylesa and Pinkish Black , shortly followed by a European tour with Kylesa and label mates Jagged Vision . They have since been on the road with Weedeater , 1000mods , the Obsessed and Wretch .
In 2016 they recorded the 'EP 72 , a concept album based on a murder that took place in their hometown in 1972 . It is written from the point of view of the 16-year-old boy who was wrongfully accused of the murder . They played the piece in its entirety at Starlight Social Club in Waterloo , steps away from where the crime scene began .
In 2017 Sierra embarked on their first headlining North American tour . Joining them was Witches of God from Los Angeles . Jason played rhythm guitar and Robbie played drums for them on that tour . The tour kicked off at the Maryland Doomfest .
Their most recent work , The Mirror , was self-released and is available on their Bandcamp page . Steve Howe from Outlaws of the Sun wrote , `` You can still feel and hear the sounds from their earlier releases but this album definitely sees Sierra playing a more confident 70s Progressive and Hard Rock sound .

Carnival Radiance ( formerly Carnival Victory ) is a operated by Carnival Cruise Line . She became the last of the three Destiny-class ships to undergo a refit and rename . The ship 's refit was completed in October 2021 , and she resumed service on 13 December .
Construction
Carnival Victory was built by Fincantieri at its Monfalcone shipyard in Friuli-Venezia Giulia , northern Italy .
Carnival Victory was launched on 31 December 1998 and later christened by Mary Frank , wife of Howard Frank , the then vice-chairman of Carnival Cruise Line . At the time of her launch , she was one of the largest cruise ships of her era .
In April 2020 the vessel was supposed to begin a $ 200 million dry dock in Cadiz , Spain . However , due to the COVID-19 pandemic the refit was delayed until mid-2021 . After this dry docking the ship was renamed Carnival Radiance . On 12 December 2021 , Carnival Radiance was christened by Shaquille O'Neal 's mother , Lucille O'Neal , in Long Beach , and the ship entered service the next day .
Design
Machinery
The ship is powered by four GMT Sulzer 16 ZAV and two GMT Sulzer 12 ZAV diesel-electric engines driving two controllable pitch propellers . She is fitted with two rudders ( which can be individually controlled ) as well as stabilizers .
Layout
Carnival Victory is themed by American designer and architect Joseph Farcus to depict the different oceans and seas of the world .
Like ( formerly Carnival Triumph ) , her architecture is different from sister ship ( formerly Carnival Destiny ) . The two newer vessels have additional balcony cabins on their Lido decks and various changes to placement and architecture of public areas . There are three large pools and a waterslide .
She has a nine-deck atrium with four glass elevators , a two-deck lounge with seating for 747 , and a total capacity of 3,400 passengers and 1,100 crew members .
On 16 October 2018 , Carnival Cruise Line announced that the ship will enter drydock on 18 March 2020 at Cadiz , Spain . She left for Cadiz on 4 March 2020 after her final voyage as Carnival Victory .
She was planned to leave drydock on 26 April 2020 after receiving a $ 200 million refurbishment , but work was halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic until the end of the year . In August 2021 , refurbishment on the ship resumed . On 1 October 2021 , she left drydock and began her journey back across the Atlantic .
During her dry dock , Carnival Radiance received the new livery that Carnival began rolling out in 2021 , starting with the Mardi Gras and Carnival Magic . She is the first of the class to receive the new wave livery .
Operation
Throughout her service , Carnival Victory has been based in Miami in the United States sailing year-round on alternating three- and four-night cruises to Caribbean destinations . On 23 July 2020 , Carnival announced that Carnival Radiances new homeport will be Long Beach , California instead of Port Canaveral , Florida as previously announced in 2018 . In 2021 , she took over the Catalina Island/Ensenada itinerary previously served by both and .

Drees borders in the north on Döttingen , in the northeast on Herresbach , Baar and Mittelbaar , in the east on Niederbaar , in the southeast on Nitz , in the south on Kirsbach , in the southwest on Welcherath , in the west on Nürburg and in the northwest on Meuspath .
History
In 1222 , Drees had its first documentary mention under the name Dreyse . The word comes from the Celtic term for `` bubbling spring '' . This is akin to the old Germanic word Thrais , for `` bubbles '' , `` to bubble '' or `` to swirl '' . The namesake mineral spring , the result of volcanic activity in the area , no longer exists .
The village belonged to the Electorate of Cologne until 1794 .
Politics
Municipal council
The council is made up of 6 council members , who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009 , and the honorary mayor as chairman .
Mayor
Drees 's mayor is Klaus Brachthäuser .
Coat of arms
The German blazon reads :
The municipality 's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus : Per fess embattled of seven , azure a fountain with four streams argent , and argent a cross tau , hanging from each arm a bell , gules .
The partition horizontally across the middle in the pattern of a crenellated wall ( `` Per fess embattled '' ) refers to the time when Drees belonged to the Electorate of Cologne Amt of Nürburg . The fountain is , in a way , a canting charge , referring to the municipality 's name , which comes from an old Celtic word for a spring ( although it hardly resembles the modern German word for this , Brunnen ) . The `` cross tau '' – one without an upper arm – is Saint Anthony 's Cross and thus a reference to the municipality 's patron saint , whose attributes include this cross and a bell , two of which also appear in these arms .

Van Reeth Glacier ( ) is a tributary glacier about 20 nautical miles ( 37 km ) long , draining westward to Scott Glacier between Mounts Blackburn and Bowlin , in the Queen Maud Mountains . It was discovered in December 1934 by the Byrd Antarctic Expedition geological party under Quin Blackburn , and was named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names ( US-ACAN ) for Commander Eugene W. Van Reeth , a pilot with U.S. Navy Squadron VX-6 in Antarctica during Operation Deep Freeze 1966 , 1967 and 1968 , and squadron commander in 1969 . Later in his career , Commander Van Reeth was promoted to captain , and eventually became the commanding officer of Operation Deep Freeze Task Force 43 in the 1970s .

Oddernes is a former municipality that was located in the old Vest-Agder county in Norway . The municipality existed from 1838 until its dissolution in 1964 . The administrative centre was the village of Lund on the east side of the river Otra near where Lund Church is located . The former area of the municipality makes up the area just west of the urban town of Kristiansand within the municipality of Kristiansand in Agder county . The old municipality encircled the town of Kristiansand , and it included the villages such as Flekkerøy , Vågsbygd , Slettheia , Lund , Strai , Mosby , and Justvik . Today , the town of Kristiansand has a borough named Oddernes , but it has very different boundaries than the old municipality had .
History
The parish of Oddernæs was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 ( see formannskapsdistrikt law ) . According to the 1835 census , the municipality had a population of 2,373 . On 31 December 1893 , the area on the east side of the Topdalsfjorden ( population : 1,113 ) was separated to form the new municipality of Randesund . The split left Oddernes with 3,076 inhabitants . On 1 July 1921 , the area of Lund ( population : 2,164 ) which is located on the headland between the mouth of the river Otra and the Topdalsfjorden was transferred from Oddernes municipality to the town of Kristiansand , constituting a new borough in the town .
During the 1960s , there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee . On 1 January 1965 , the town of Kristiansand ( population : 27,100 ) was greatly expanded by merging with the neighboring municipalities of Oddernes ( population : 18,668 ) , Randesund ( population : 1,672 ) , and Tveit ( population : 2,802 ) .
Today , the borough of Oddernes hardly corresponds to the old municipality . In fact , the Hånes area in Oddernes borough is the only part of the borough that was also in the old municipality of Oddernes . Other places in Kristiansand that were a part of Oddernes was the entire Vågsbygd borough ( except for Voiebyen ) as well as Hellemyr , Strai , Mosby , Lund , and Justvik . Oddernes Church is now actually located in the borough of Lund , but it still has the same name today . Similarly , the old Oddernes High School is located in Vågsbygd Centrum , but it changed the name to Vågsbygd High School since it is no longer in Oddernes .
Name
The municipality ( originally the parish ) is named after the old Oddernæs farm ( ) since this is where the Oddernes Church was located . The first part of the name comes from its location along the Otra river , and nes means peninsula , so the peninsula along the Otra river .
Government
All municipalities in Norway , including Oddernes , are responsible for primary education ( through 10th grade ) , outpatient health services , senior citizen services , unemployment and other social services , zoning , economic development , and municipal roads . The municipality was governed by a municipal council of elected representatives , which in turn elected a mayor .
Municipal council
The municipal council of Oddernes was made up of representatives that were elected to four year terms . The party breakdown of the final municipal council was as follows :

The red-backed thrush or rusty-backed thrush ( Geokichla erythronota ) is a species of bird in the family Turdidae . Traditionally , it included the red-and-black thrush ( Z. mendeni ) as a subspecies . It is endemic to forests on Sulawesi and the nearby islands of Buton and Kabaena in Indonesia . It is becoming rare due to habitat destruction .
Taxonomy
Geokichla erythronota is very similar in morphology to the chestnut-backed thrush ( Geokichla dohertyi ) and some authorities believe they are conspecific . Others believe they are distinct . A subspecies ( G. e. kabaena ) has been named from Kabaena and some researchers believe there is an unnamed race of G. erythronota on the island of Buton , the status of which needs to be evaluated .
Description
The red-backed thrush is about long and the sexes are largely similar in appearance .

Mount Maunganui ( , ) is a major residential , commercial and industrial suburb of the Tauranga metropolitan area , located on a peninsula to the north-east of Tauranga 's city centre . It was an independent town from Tauranga until the completion of the Tauranga Harbour Bridge in 1988 , which connects Mount Maunganui to Tauranga 's central business district .
Mount Maunganui is also the name of the large lava dome which was formed by the upwelling of rhyolite lava about two to three million years ago . It is officially known by its Māori name Mauao , but is colloquially known in New Zealand simply as The Mount .
The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of `` large mountain '' for Maunganui .
Geography
Mount Maunganui is located atop a sand bar that connects Mauao to the mainland , a geographical formation known as a tombolo . Because of this formation , the residents of Mount Maunganui have both a harbour beach ( Pilot Bay ) and an ocean beach with great surf , within a short distance . At the base of Mauao , the distance between the harbour and ocean side is a couple of blocks .
The ocean beach has Mauao or Mount Maunganui at its western end , and a man made land bridge connecting Moturiki Island at its eastern end .
Adjacent to Mount Maunganui on its south-eastern edge ( from Sandhurst Drive onwards ) is Papamoa Beach , another very large suburb of Tauranga . Papamoa Beach has a slightly larger population than Mount Maunganui , but does n't have as many businesses as Mount Maunganui . Both suburbs are distinctly geographically separate from the rest of Tauranga by the Tauranga Harbour ; two bridges ( SH2 and SH29 ) and the winding Welcome Bay Road are the only connections by land to the central business district .
Mauao ( The Mount ) is a large lava dome which rises above the town . According to Maori legend , this hill was a pononga [ slave ] to a mountain called Otanewainuku . The conical headland which gives the town its name is in height , and dominates the mostly flat surrounding countryside . It was formerly a Māori pā , and the remains of trenches can be seen in the ridges , as well as ancient shell middens . Today , it is open to the public year-round , and is a popular place to either walk around , or climb up . From the summit , a good stretch of coastline can be seen in either direction , as well as the Kaimai Range to the west .
Demographics
Mount Maunganui , comprising the statistical areas of Mount Maunganui North , Mount Maunganui South and Mount Maunganui Central , had a population of 6,510 at the 2018 New Zealand census , an increase of 696 people ( 12.0 % ) since the 2013 census , and an increase of 1,176 people ( 22.0 % ) since the 2006 census . There were 2,724 households . There were 3,264 males and 3,249 females , giving a sex ratio of 1.0 males per female , with 918 people ( 14.1 % ) aged under 15 years , 1,332 ( 20.5 % ) aged 15 to 29 , 3,153 ( 48.4 % ) aged 30 to 64 , and 1,101 ( 16.9 % ) aged 65 or older .
Ethnicities were 90.2 % European/Pākehā , 13.3 % Māori , 1.4 % Pacific peoples , 3.2 % Asian , and 3.3 % other ethnicities ( totals add to more than 100 % since people could identify with multiple ethnicities ) .
The proportion of people born overseas was 20.6 % , compared with 27.1 % nationally .
Although some people objected to giving their religion , 58.8 % had no religion , 32.1 % were Christian , 0.6 % were Hindu , 0.6 % were Buddhist and 2.6 % had other religions .
Of those at least 15 years old , 1,584 ( 28.3 % ) people had a bachelor or higher degree , and 675 ( 12.1 % ) people had no formal qualifications . The employment status of those at least 15 was that 3,090 ( 55.3 % ) people were employed full-time , 837 ( 15.0 % ) were part-time , and 141 ( 2.5 % ) were unemployed .
Politics
Over the years Mount Maunganui had suffered a number of attacks on its sovereignty by Tauranga but had fought fully and effectively to remain independent until the 1989 local government reforms .
During 1974 Bob Owens was Mayor of both Mount Maunganui and Tauranga , a unique situation in the annals of local government in New Zealand . Mr Owens made no secret of the fact that he favoured the joining of the two municipalities . The election of 1974 was fought on this issue and Owens was defeated in the polls in Mount Maunganui with a landslide victory to Mr L. Kelvin O'Hara , the youngest person elected to the position of Mayor in New Zealand , who challenged him on the issue , and other environmental issues with the catch cry `` why share a mayor ? ''
It remains controversial in Mount Maunganui whether the transition from an independently administered unit of local government to a minor part of the Tauranga City Council over 20 years ago was beneficial .
Some Mount Maunganui residents are still of the opinion Tauranga and Mount Maunganui are separate towns , even though they officially amalgamated in 1989 . Simon Bridges , the local Member of Parliament for the area , described it in Parliament in 2012 `` I have to say that there still is , though—and I have found this when first standing for Parliament—a sense of the `` Mounties '' and of those who are city-side , and that is still present to some extent ''
History
Mount Maunganui was known colloquially as Maunganui until 1907 ; during the application process to formally name the area when the first subdivision of land was carried out , Maunganui was dismissed as being too similar to several other towns ' names . One of the early settlers , J.C. Adams , then suggested three alternative names , which were Te Maire , Tamure ( the Māori name for Snapper ) , and Rakataura , with the latter name selected by the Survey Department . The official name Rakataura never came into common use , as Maunganui had long been the unofficial name of the area . The name Mount Maunganui originated as a rebranding by early developers , who succeeded in changing the official name of the town from Rakataura . The current name is an example of a tautological place name , maunga being a Māori term for mountain ( nui means `` big '' ) .
Mount Maunganui fought fiercely and successfully during the 1950s to retain independence from Tauranga , then failed with the completion of the harbour bridge in 1988 .
The former Mount Maunganui Borough Council set records in New Zealand as having never had a deficit in its history , something which Tauranga City Council has never achieved . Critics say the town was built by leveraging the commercial and industrial ratepayers , but Mount Maunganui was a forerunner in some areas and applied the user pays philosophy before it was common in New Zealand .
The original house of early settler J.C. Adams , the first home built at Mount Maunganui , still stands at 4 Adams Avenue . The 1906 house is registered with Heritage New Zealand as a Category II historic building .
The local Whareroa Marae and Rauru ki Tahi meeting house is a meeting place for the Ngāi Te Rangi hapū of Ngāti Kuku and Ngāi Tukairangi .
Character
Mount Maunganui is regarded by many to be a coastal resort town , although Port of Tauranga , a major facility , is also partly located on the western ( harbour ) side . It is also well known for the quality of its surfing conditions , though parts of the beach are notoriously dangerous . The harbour bridge was opened in 1988 , linking Mount Maunganui with Tauranga . The construction of a duplication bridge was completed in December 2009 , forming a vital link in Tauranga and Mount Maunganui 's growing motorway system .
A large container terminal and overseas wharf is located at Mount Maunganui . A branch railway from the East Coast Main Trunk railway runs between the Te Maunga and northern parts of the suburb .
Mount Maunganui also features the popular Bayfair Shopping Centre . The centre is one of the largest in the North Island outside Auckland and Wellington .
Mount Maunganui is a popular New Years destination , with over 20,000 people frequenting the suburb over the New Years period . Many festivities take place on and around the main beach in the north of the suburb .
As part of the Port of Tauranga is located in Mount Maunganui , there are many cruise ship visits annually to the suburb .
Sport
The suburb is home to the cricket ground Bay Oval , which held the 2018 ICC Under 19 Cricket World Cup final on 3 February 2018 .
Every year Mount Maunganui hosts the Northern Regional Surf Championships ( NRC 's ) , and other events such as the NZ Under 14 Ocean Athlete Championships , the Pro Volleyball Tour and The Port of Tauranga Half Ironman triathlon .
Artificial reef
New Zealand 's first artificial reef was installed at the Mount . Construction of the reef was hampered by lack of funds and ironically , too many waves . Initially the public was told the reef would cost about $ 500k , but costs escalated to $ 800k . Media reported that local surfers are disappointed with the waves produced by the reef . The reef has also been blamed for creating rips and has now been removed .

The Battle of Apple River Fort , occurred on the late afternoon of June 24 , 1832 at the Apple River Fort , near present-day Elizabeth , Illinois , when Black Hawk and 200 of his `` British Band '' of Sauk and Fox were surprised by a group of four messengers en route from Galena , Illinois . One of the couriers was wounded in the thigh as the riders quickly made for the protection of the nearby stockade . Courier Fred Dixon lagged behind and provided cover for his comrades . The other couriers rode ahead to warn some 70 settlers of the approaching Sauk and Fox , thus saving their lives . The small company of militia at the fort , about 28-30 men and boys led by Captain Clack Stone , fought off Black Hawk 's 150-man war party in an action that lasted about an hour . The withering pace of the gunfire eventually convinced Black Hawk that the fort was too heavily defended to lead a direct attack . He considered burning the fort , then switched to raiding cabins of foodstuffs , clothing and cooking utensils . In the gathering darkness , Black Hawk and his war party retreated .
After the battle , some of the fort defenders won praise for their efforts to repel the Indian attack . Among them were : Elizabeth Winters , Rebecca Hitt , Sarah Vanvoltinburg , and Elizabeth Armstrong . Mrs. Armstrong rallied the 40 or so women and children who had taken shelter inside the fort . The women and children were divided into two groups : one to mold rifle balls and another to roll paper cartridges and fill them with a measure of gunpowder into paper cartridges . Some of the married women reload weapons so that the militia could increase the pace of their fire . Courier George Harkleroad was struck in the neck and mortally wounded : the fort 's only fatality . Native casualties remain unknown , although some defenders later reported blood on the ground and inside a nearby building .
For some time afterward , the old fort was used by local squatters . The former battlefield and the fort remains were sold in 1847 . The new owner re-purposed many of the timbers from the fort to build a livestock barn . What remained was burned . Today , a replica fort was built near the original site in the late 1990s and still stands in Elizabeth . The site is managed by the IDNR as `` Apple River Fort State Historical Site . ''
Background
As a consequence of the 1804 Treaty of St. Louis between William H. Harrison the Governor of Indiana Territory and a group of Sac and Fox leaders regarding land settlement , the Sac and Fox tribes vacated their lands in Illinois and moved west of the Mississippi in 1828 . However , the Sac 's principle warrior Black Hawk and others disputed the treaty , claiming that the full tribal councils had not been consulted , nor did those representing the tribes have authorization to cede lands . Angered by the loss of his birthplace , between 1830–31 Black Hawk led a number of incursions across the Mississippi River , but was persuaded to return west each time without bloodshed . In April 1832 , encouraged by promises of alliance with other Great Lakes tribes and supplies from the British in Canada , he again moved his so-called `` British Band '' of around 500 warriors and a like number of families and non-combatants into Illinois . Finding no allies among the local Ho Chunk , he attempted to return to Iowa , but was temporarily stopped by the presence of several companies of militia . As night fell , the undisciplined Illinois militia fled before Black Hawk 's warriors in a skirminsh known today as Battle of Stillman 's Run . A number of other engagements followed , and the militias of Michigan Territory and Illinois were mobilized to hunt down Black Hawk 's Band . The conflict became known as the Black Hawk War .
The period between Stillman 's Run and the Battle of Apple River Fort was filled with war-related activity and events . A series of attacks at Buffalo Grove , the Plum River settlement , Fort Blue Mounds and one of the conflict 's most infamous incidents : the Indian Creek massacre , all took place between mid-May and late June 1832 . The week preceding the Battle of Apple River Fort was an important turning point for the militia : between June 16–18 two small but important fights occurred . One was known as `` Stephenson 's Fight ' '' today incorrectly called Waddams Grove and the other at Horseshoe Bendin present-day Wisconsin , played a key role in changing public perception about the militia after its defeat at Stillman 's Run .
Prelude
Following the militia 's disastrous defeat at Stillman 's Run on May 14 , settlers in the lead-mining region around Galena panicked ; many left the area altogether . The exaggerated claim that 2,000 `` bloodthirsty warriors were sweeping all Northern Illinois with the bosom of destruction '' sent terror through the region . At the Apple River Settlement , the situation prompted residents to form a 46-man militia tentatively under Captain Vance L. Davidson . By late May , Davidson was at the Plum River settlement ( present-day Savanna , Illinois ) and Captain Clack Stone had been elected to command the militia company . The single blockhouse at Apple River Fort was completed around May 22 ; the stockade was completed sometime later . In the days immediately preceding June 18 , 1832 , Apple River Fort 's horses were raided and stolen during the night . This incident was one of several around that time that led Illinois militia officer James W. Stephenson to clash with a handful of warriors at `` Stephenson 's Fight '' ( later erroneously named Waddams Grove on June 18 .
On June 24 , 1832 , a supply wagon loaded with meat and lead bars from Galena arrived at Apple River Fort around noon . Around this time , Black Hawk and his 200-man war party also en route to the fort , had gathered at a gap in Terrapin Ridge . Black Hawk 's forces were able to elude detection until the time they opened fire . At around 4 p.m. four couriers from Galena bound for the army camp at Dixon 's Ferry arrived at the fort . The fort 's occupants were eager to hear their news from Galena and of the conflict with Black Hawk .
There were 28-30 armed militias inside Apple River Fort at the time of the attack . Another 40 women , children and other settlers were resident in the Apple River Settlement . Captain Clack Stone and his officers commanded the fort 's defenders . Most of the defenders were members of Stone 's militia company augmented by a few civilians . A few of the militia company were away from the stockade and were not present for the battle .
Battle
The four riders from Galena ; George Harkleroad , Fred Dixon , Edmund Welch , and J. Kirkpatrick were under orders as a military messengers known as an `` express '' . They were traveling from Galena to Dixon . The men stopped at the fort , consumed a quick dinner , and then continued on their way . The group was about 600 yards ( 550 m ) east of the fort when the only man with a loaded gun , Welch , was ambushed by Black Hawk 's advance-guard of about 30 warriors . He was shot in the hip and fell from his horse . His companions aimed their unloaded weapons at the band , putting themselves between the wounded man and his attackers . The group recovered Welch and moved away from their assailants toward the fort . Fred Dixon , covered the retreat of his fellow express men as they raced for the fort . Three of the expressmen gained the safety of the fort , while Dixon fled on horseback towards the Apple River and ended up at the farm of John McDonald , only to find it overrun by Native Americans as well . Dixon then abandoned his horse , waded the river , and managed to gain the road to Galena , where he reported the Apple River Fort to be under attack .
The settlers took shelter inside the fort while the men and boys took up their positions at the portholes inside the fort . A vicious firefight erupted , involving around 150 of Black Hawk 's British Band . The battle raged for about an hour with heavy gunfire from both sides . At the battle 's onset many of the settlement 's women had been huddled in and around the cabins , but several married woman , including Elizabeth Armstrong , rallied the women and older children to provide support to the soldiers . She assigned the unmarried young women , boys , and girls as young as eight years old to such tasks as cutting and rolling gunpowder cartridges and molding rifleballs . The married women reloaded the weapons while the soldiers tried to maintain an increased rate of fire .
The ferocity of the fight convinced Black Hawk that Apple River Fort was strongly defended . He considered burning the fort , but feared the rising smoke would alert other militia in the area . His war-party slackened their fire as braves raided cabins near the fort . Taken were meat , flour , clothing , cooking utensils . Left behind was a paucity of real vandalism . Braves then raided the livestock : horses were run off and pigs and cattle were shot down and the choicest cut of meat taken . In the gathering darkness , Black Hawk quietly withdrew his war party and retreated back to the gap in Terrapin Ridge and gained the Galena Road . Casualties were few , given the intensity of the battle . Courier George Harkleroad was shot in the neck early in the battle and died ; it has been documented that he was killed while peering over the stockade wall 's pickets . Besides Welch , the only other garrison casualty was Josiah Nutting , who suffered a non-lethal wound to the side of his head . The number of Sauk casualties is unknown .
Aftermath
The defenders at Apple River Fort awaited the next move by Black Hawk , holding their positions through the night , but dawn came without incident . On the day following the battle , June 25 , a relief party consisting of two companies of mounted rangers arrived at the fort from Galena . That same day , Black Hawk 's war-party encountered Major John Dement and his three-company Spy Battalion at the Second Battle of Kellogg 's Grove . Apple River Fort 's only fatality , George Harkleroad , was buried near the fort ; today no trace of his grave exists .
Elizabeth Armstrong was praised by some as a heroine for her actions during the battle , displaying the kind of courage under fire the militia had so badly lacked during the first months of the Black Hawk War . Her actions , in part , helped the fort 's outnumbered defenders give Black Hawk the impression the Apple River Fort was more heavily defended than had been anticipated .
Initially , some writers confused the name of the woman who played such an important role at Apple River Fort ; a 1900 collection from the Wisconsin Historical Society misidentified her as `` Mrs . Graham . '' Several years after the fight , an itinerant Methodist minister heard the story of the Apple River Fort fight from a `` Mr . Jewel , '' a man who settled in Jo Daviess County after the Black Hawk War . Jewel told a story of Armstrong `` cursing & swearing like a pirate '' throughout the battle ; so angry that even Black Hawk 's warriors purported to hear her . The Methodist minister pronounced such action as `` profane '' and `` a great drawback upon her credit . ''
The fort was demolished around 1847 and its timbers used to construct a barn . Today , the fort and its three buildings have been reconstructed by the Apple River Fort Historic Foundation . The Apple River Fort Site is listed twice on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places for its military and archaeological significance .
On January 1 , 2001 , the state of Illinois took over operation of the reconstructed Apple River Fort and its interpretive center . The state now operates the area as the Apple River Fort State Historic Site . Illinois ' purchase was funded , in part , through a US $ 160,000 grant from the state of Illinois .

Kelling 's test is a chemical test used for detecting the presence of lactic acid in gastric juice .
Procedure
Two drops of iron ( III ) chloride are added to a test tube with distilled water . After mixing , it is divided into two parts . Add one millilitre of gastric juice in one test tube and the same volume of distilled water in the other test tube , which is acting as a control . The test tube with the gastric juice turns yellow in the presence of lactic acid due to the formation of ferric lactate .

Plot
New York City society matron Millicent Jordan is overjoyed when she receives word that Lord and Lady Ferncliffe , the richest couple in England , have accepted her invitation to her upcoming dinner party . However , her husband Oliver , a shipping magnate , finds Lord Ferncliffe a bore . Their daughter , Paula , is preoccupied with the impending return of her fiancé , Ernest DeGraff , from Europe .
Oliver asks Millicent to invite legendary stage actress Carlotta Vance , who has just arrived from Europe . A former lover of Oliver 's , Carlotta confesses to him that she is nearly penniless and is interested in selling her stock in the Jordan Shipping Line , but he lacks the funds , as his business has been severely affected by the Great Depression .
Nouveau riche magnate Dan Packard , a former miner , agrees to consider helping Oliver , but later brags to his young , gold-digger wife , Kitty , that he plans to take over the Jordan Shipping Line through crooked stock purchases . Oliver convinces Millicent to invite the Packards . While Kitty eagerly accepts the invitation , Dan refuses to go , but changes his mind when he learns that Lord Ferncliffe will be in attendance .
On the morning of her dinner , Millicent loses the `` extra man '' she found for Carlotta . She telephones Larry Renault , a washed-up silent film star , and extends a last-minute invitation , unaware that Paula is in his hotel room . Larry and Paula have been having an affair for a month , but he wants to end it , citing their age difference ( he is 47 and she is 19 ) and the fact that he is a three-time divorcé . Paula insists that she loves him , planning to tell her family and Ernest about their affair . Carlotta , who is staying in the same hotel , sees Paula leave Larry 's room .
Larry , a hardened alcoholic , is on the brink of physical and economic collapse . His agent , Max Kane , tells him that the stage play he was set to star in has a new producer , Jo Stengel . Stengel decided to cast another actor in the lead role , but is willing to consider Larry in a bit part .
The Jordans ' physician and friend Dr. Wayne Talbot has been having an affair with Kitty on the pretext of tending to her feigned illnesses . On the day of the dinner , his wife , Lucy , catches him in a compromising telephone call with Kitty . Talbot admits that he is a serial adulterer and vows to overcome his impulses . Lucy is surprisingly understanding , and the two kiss . Talbot receives a visit from an ailing Oliver , who is diagnosed with terminal thrombosis of the coronary arteries . At home , Oliver tries to tell Millicent that he needs to rest , but she is too hysterical to pay attention to him because , among several domestic disasters , the Ferncliffes have canceled .
During a vicious fight , Kitty spitefully reveals to Dan that she is having an affair . When threatened with divorce , she demands that he back down from his takeover of the Jordan Line and treat her with more respect , or else she will sabotage his potential Cabinet appointment by exposing his crooked deals . Defeated , Dan storms off .
Before he leaves for the dinner , Larry is visited by Max and Stengel . Upon discovering that the role being offered to him is that of a dead man , Larry drunkenly insults Stengel , who leaves in haste . Frustrated , Max forces Larry to face reality by bluntly asserting that he has no future in show business , before leaving . To make matters worse , the hotel manager tells Larry he has until the next day to leave . Larry , in utter despair , commits suicide by turning on his gas fireplace .
The dinner guests arrive at the Jordans ' mansion . Carlotta informs Paula that Larry has killed himself , consoling the young woman as she breaks down in tears . Millicent learns about Oliver 's health and financial setbacks . Realizing her own selfishness , Millicent tells Oliver that she is willing to adopt a more frugal lifestyle . As the guests are about to go in to dinner , Kitty pressures Dan to tell Oliver that he has saved the Jordan Line .

Gustav Lindenthal ( May 21 , 1850 – July 31 , 1935 ) was a civil engineer who designed the Hell Gate Bridge in New York City , among other bridges .
Lindenthal 's work was greatly affected by his pursuit for perfection and his love of art . Having received little formal education and no degree in civil engineering , Lindenthal based his work on his prior experience and techniques used by other engineers of the time .
Early life
Lindenthal was born in Brünn , Austrian Empire , now Brno , Czech Republic in 1850 . Lindenthal began to receive practical training in 1866 when he was employed as a mason and carpenter . At the age of 18 , Lindenthal left his family to set out to make a life of his own in Vienna , Austria .
Career
When he arrived in Vienna he became an assistant in the engineering department for the Empress Elisabeth Railway of Austria . Two years later he joined the Union Construction Company , where he gained experience in building incline planes and railroads . Then a year later he decided to join the Swiss National Railroad , where he was hired on as a division engineer in charge of location and construction . While living in Vienna , he attended some public engineering lectures at a local university . However , he never did actually attend the university or receive a degree . Lindenthal in fact taught himself mathematics , engineering theory , metallurgy , hydraulics , estimating , management , and everything else that a successful bridge engineer needed to know . Nevertheless , the lack of his formal education hindered him from further advancement in Europe , so he decided to emigrate to the United States in 1874 .
When he first arrived in the United States he was employed as a journeyman stonemason for the memorial granite building of the Centennial International Exhibition in Philadelphia in 1876 . After completion of this project , Lindenthal worked for the Keystone Bridge Company of Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , on numerous projects over a three-year period . While working for this company , he gained valuable experience which propelled him to the status of bridge engineer . He worked for the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad during 1879 to 1881 .
In 1881 , Lindenthal established his own consulting business and built four bridges in the Pittsburgh area : 30th Street Bridge ( Herrs Island ) ; Smithfield Street Bridge ( over the Monongahela River ; 1883 ) , Youghiogheny River Bridge at McKeesport ( 1883 ) ; and the Seventh Street Bridge ( Allegheny River ; 1884 ) . In 1884 , he founded the North River Bridge Company in New York , with the intent of building a massive bridge over the Hudson River for the Pennsylvania Railroad ( PRR ) . Although the PRR ultimately decided to build tunnels under the river rather than a bridge , the two companies continued their relationship . The PRR hired Lindenthal in 1904 to work on the New York Connecting Railroad and lead the Hell Gate Bridge project . The completed bridge was dedicated by Lindenthal and the PRR on March 9 , 1917 .
Lindenthal 's career transitioned to public service when he was appointed to lead the New York City Department of Bridges from 1902 through 1903 . As Commissioner of Bridges , he managed several projects spanning the East River , and had a major role in designing the Queensboro Bridge and Hell Gate Bridge . In one of the more novel initiatives of his tenure , Lindenthal advocated for the construction of continuous `` moving platform '' transit systems in lieu of traditional subway trains on the Brooklyn Bridge and Williamsburg Bridge . While the proposals ultimately remained unbuilt , the city would eventually host a similar ( albeit scaled-down ) concept sixty years later with the Ford Motor Company `` Magic Skyway '' attraction at the 1964 New York World 's Fair .
The North River Bridge Company developed another proposal for a large Hudson River suspension bridge in 1920 . This design would have been built at 57th Street in Manhattan , to carry both roadway and railroads , but neither the city nor the railroads were supportive . ( Lindenthal 's colleague Othmar Ammann developed a scaled-down bridge proposal several years later , which became the George Washington Bridge , completed in 1931 . ) Lindenthal worked on several other bridge projects around the country in the 1920s . Perhaps his most famous and lasting achievement outside of New York is the Sciotoville Bridge , a rail crossing of the Ohio River , completed about the same time as the Hell Gate Bridge .
Lindenthal had a difference in opinion with one of the standard engineering practices of the day . Prior to the automobile train construction represented the majority of transport building that took place . Trains being as heavy as they were made engineers greatly overcompensate and build bridges that were oversized , bulky , and expensive . Lindenthal pointed out that bridges did not have to support the full load of a train as a single point load . Instead , a train moves across the bridge and displaces its load relatively evenly . This was not how the bridges were tested to see if a design worked though . The train 's total dead weight was simply added to the bridge , and if it did not hold , it was said to be structurally unstable . Lindenthal 's idea of not having to carry the full load allowed bridge designers to create bridges that were still stable , but at the same time much lighter and cheaper .
Gustav Lindenthal made bridges that reached new heights for his time . At the time of Hell Gate 's completion , it stood as the longest and heaviest steel bridge in the world . Gustav Lindenthal also expanded the idea of `` double decker '' lanes on his bridges . The Queensboro Bridge is one of the bridges Lindenthal designed that displays the double decker idea .
Construction techniques
During the time Lindenthal practiced engineering , the railroad industry was expanding and replacing many wooden-truss bridges with stronger ones capable of handling the heavier locomotive loads . In order to accommodate these heavier trains , different construction materials were being utilized . The materials being considered by engineers like Lindenthal were reinforced concrete , cable , and steel . Steel and reinforced concrete were two main materials used in the truss bridges Lindenthal designed . The use of reinforced concrete was a relatively new idea in bridge construction , with its first use in 1889 .
The design of the Hell Gate Bridge required a different approach to bridge construction . Nearly all major members of Hell Gate are composed of smaller trusses . The erection of the Hell Gate was carried through without the assistance of any falsework , or work that was not part of the actual bridge . This was accomplished by building the two halves of the arch simultaneously from each tower . The steel work was supported with the use of cables during construction to carry the load of the arches until they finally met at the center of the span .
In another instance , a bridge needed to be constructed over the Monongahela River , after the ferry , which was used for many years beforehand , became outdated . The first bridge , designed by John Roebling , continuously swayed and deflected , and was being `` shaky and loose . '' Lindenthal was given an opportunity to design a replacement , the Smithfield Street Bridge in Pittsburgh . This bridge , completed in 1883 using the structural form of a lenticular truss , could withstand higher stresses , as well as using resources that made it more economical ( Approximately $ 23,000 was saved simply by using these materials ) . `` Lindenthal 's use of steel instead of iron wherever possible was based upon economy as much as anything . ''
Personal life
At the age of eighty-five , Lindenthal succumbed to a long illness and died shortly after , at his home in Metuchen , New Jersey . Lindenthal 's Metuchen property extended northward towards Oak Tree Road into Raritan Township ( present-day Edison , New Jersey ) , and was later bough by contractor Frank P. Tufaro for the development of the Stephenville community . Up until that point , he remained active as president and chief engineer of the North River Bridge Company .

Schortens is a town in the district of Friesland in Lower Saxony , Germany .
Division of the town
The town currently consists of the following districts : Schortens , Heidmühle , Grafschaft , Accum , Sillenstede , Schoost , Roffhausen , Middelsfähr , Addernhausen , Oestringfelde , Ostiem and Upjever .
History
Graves discovered during excavations in the 1970s indicate the existence of an early human settlement in the area of Schortens already during the 5th century .
In 1158 Schortens was first mentioned as `` Scrotinh '' in a document of Pope Adrian IV . Later the name changed to `` Scrotinghe '' . In 1400 the place was called `` Schortense '' .
The St. Stephan Church in Schortens was built shortly after 1153 as a result of a victory of the Östringer against a superior army .
In the Middle Ages , the monastery of Oestringfelde , which was also used as an asylum , was well known for its horse breeding .
During the second half of the 1900s , the naval base Wilhelmshaven contributed greatly to the development of the town . Many workers settled down in what would become central Schortens , a railway connection to Jever , established in 1871 also contributed to the development of the town . After the end of World War I , the production of warships ceased and unemployment escalated . From 1946 , a steady stream of refugees has moved to Schortens , increasing the population greatly . The deployment of the Olympia-Werke typewriter factory in Roffhausen just after World War II is also seen as an important stage in the development of the town . Around 1970 , this factory had jobs for 12,000 people , thus preventing unemployment in the entire region . The Olympia works had to shut down in 1992 .
In 1933 Schortens united with the towns of Cleverns and Sande to form the Greater Oestringen , this union was however dissolved during World War II .
In 1936 an air force base in Upjever was opened , which is still in use today .
Schortens received municipal rights on January 21 , 2005 . Since June 1 , 2005 , the city of Schortens is an independent municipality .

Phytopharmacology is the study and practice of eradicating plant pathology originated from the Verbandes Deutscher Pflanzenärzte ( 1928–1939 ) , ( German Plant Physicians Society ) , headed by Otto Appel , known as the Organiser of German Plant Protection , who initially defined the terminology of Phyto-Medicine or Plant Medicine . The Deutsche Phytomedizinische Gesellschaft ( German Phytomedicine Society ) is the German association of phytomedicine practitioners . Academic programs in phytomedicine , such as at the University of Hohenheim , consider the interrelationships between pathogenic microorganisms and crops , disease control methods , and research programs .
In 1936 , the term phytopharmacology was used for the field of study on drugs that affect plants .

Charles Lloyd ( 26 September 1784 – 31 May 1829 ) , Regius Professor of Divinity and Bishop of Oxford from 1827 to 1829 , was born in West Wycombe , Buckinghamshire on 26 September 1784 , the second son of Thomas Lloyd and grandson of Nathaniel Ryder , 1st Baron Harrowby . Thomas , a 'clergyman and schoolmaster ' , was Rector of Aston-sub-Edge in Gloucestershire and ran a school at Great Missenden . Charles went to Eton , his education being paid for by scholarships . He was evidently a considerable scholar , achieving a first at Christ Church , Oxford in 1806 ( proceeding to MA in 1809 ) , a BD in 1818 and a DD in 1821 . Eventually he had to leave and took a job as a tutor to Lord Elgin 's children at Dunfermline . This did n't last long as he was asked to return to Oxford to teach mathematics . One of his first jobs was to prepare Robert Peel for his exams . Peel later became prime minister , and remained a lifelong friend of Lloyd . Charles Lloyd soon gained a reputation as an effective teacher .
Ordained in 1808 , Lloyd held the curacies of Drayton ( 1810 ) and Binsey ( 1818 ) , both near Oxford . In June 1819 he was appointed under Peel 's influence to the preachership of Lincoln 's Inn , which he held until February 1822 when , on the nomination of Lord Liverpool , he was appointed to the Regius Professorship of Divinity at Oxford , to which was attached a canonry at Christ Church and the rectory of Ewelme . On 15 August 1822 he married Mary Harriet ( died 1857 ) , and within four years they had a family of one son and three daughters .
As Regius Professor , Lloyd revived theological studies in the university . He supplemented his statutory public lectures with private classes attended by graduates , who included Richard Hurrell Froude , John Henry Newman , Frederick Oakeley , and Edward Bouverie Pusey ( it was on Lloyd 's suggestion that Pusey went to Germany to study its theology ) . These are figures who became prominent in what was known as the Oxford Movement , which did so much to revitalise the worship and witness of the Church .
Lloyd is noted for an 1827 pocket edition of the Greek New Testament incorporating the Eusebian canons .
Lloyd 's studies of the ancient roots and historical development of the Anglican liturgy and dogma influenced a generation of Oxford theologians . Short , stocky , and prematurely bald , Lloyd was remembered for informally bantering with , and occasionally bullying , the attendees at his private lectures . For a wider clerical readership he published a collection of Formularies of Faith Put Forth by Authority during the Reign of Henry VIII ( 1825 ) .
On 4 March 1827 he was consecrated as the Bishop of Oxford , a position he longed for and lobbied hard for , imploring his former pupil Robert Peel , now Home Secretary , to use his influence with Lord Liverpool . Lloyd remained a professor at the university and set about reforming the diocese . There was a particular problem with pluralism and non-residence at the time . It was common for clergy to hold several posts and to 'subcontract ' their duties to a poorly paid curate . He was also involved in the contentious legislation for Catholic emancipation , finally passed in 1829 . During the Lords ' debates on emancipation he delivered an important speech in favour of reform ( 2 April 1829 ) , a stand which made him a favourite scapegoat of defeated conservatives . Shortly afterwards George IV snubbed him at a public function .
His hard work inevitably took its toll on his health . Mentally distressed and physically fatigued , Lloyd attended an anniversary dinner at the Royal Academy at Somerset House , where he caught a cold that lingered and worsened . He died of pneumonia on 31 May 1829 at the house in Whitehall Place , London , which he had rented for the summer season . Two days later he was given a private funeral in Lincoln 's Inn chapel , and was interred in the Benchers ' vault .
John Henry Newman wrote warmly of his friend and former tutor when he said , 'He brought me forward , made me known , spoke well of me , and gave me confidence in myself ' .
A monument to his memory in Oxford Cathedral was sculpted by Joseph Theakston .

Satet , Satit or Satjet , Satjit in Ancient Egyptian ( or , . `` Pourer '' or `` Shooter '' ) , Greek : Satis , also known by numerous related names , was an Upper Egyptian goddess who , along with Khnum and Anuket , formed part of the Elephantine Triad . A protective deity of Egypt 's southern border with Nubia , she came to personify the former annual flooding of the Nile and to serve as a war , hunting , and fertility goddess .
She was sometimes conflated with Isis and Sopdet , goddess of the bright star Sirius , which the Egyptians connected with the onset of the Nile flooding . Under the interpretatio graeca , she was conflated with Hera and Juno .
Names
The exact pronunciation of Egyptian is often uncertain since vowels were not recorded until a very late period . In transcription , the goddess 's name also appears as Setis , Sati , Setet , Satet , Satit , and Sathit . Derived from , meaning `` eject '' , `` shoot '' , `` pour '' , or `` throw '' , her name can be variously translated as `` She who Shoots '' or `` She who Pours '' depending on which of her roles is being emphasized .
Her name was originally written with the hieroglyph for a linen garment 's shoulder knot ( S29 ) ; this was later replaced by Anuket 's animal hide pierced by an arrow ( F29 ) . She was also known by epithets , such as `` Mistress of Elephantine '' and `` She Who Runs Like an Arrow '' , thought to refer to the flowing river current .
History
A goddess of the Upper Egyptians , her cult is first attested on jars beneath the Step Pyramid of Saqqara ( Dynasty III ) . She appears in the Pyramid Texts ( Dynasty VI ) purifying a deceased pharaoh 's body with four jars of water from Elephantine .
Her principal center of worship was at Abu ( Elephantine ) , an island in Aswan on the southern edge of Egypt . Her temple there occupied an early predynastic site shown by Wells to be aligned with the star Sirius . Other centers include Swenet ( Aswan proper ) and Setet ( Sehel Island nearby ) . She was particularly associated with the upper reaches of the Nile , which the Egyptians sometimes considered to have its source near Aswan . She is invoked in Aramaic as Sati on a divorce document in the Elephantine papyri .
Myths
As a war goddess , Satis protected Egypt 's southern Nubian frontier by killing the enemies of the pharaoh with her sharp arrows .
As a fertility goddess , she was thought to grant the wishes of those who sought love .
She seems to have originally been paired with the Theban god Montu but later replaced Heket as the consort of Khnum , guardian of the source of the Nile . By Khnum , her child was Anuket , goddess of the Nile . After Khnum was conflated with Ra , she sometimes became an Eye of Ra in place of Hathor .
Together Khnum , Anuket , and Satis formed the Elephantine Triad .
Representation
Satis was usually pictured as a woman in a sheath dress wearing the hedjet , the conical crown of Upper Egypt , with antelope horns . She is sometimes depicted with bow and arrows ; holding an ankh or scepter ; or offering jars of purifying water .
She also appears in the form of an antelope .
Her symbols were the arrow and the running river .

( listed in The Music Guide to the Blues , the Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music ) was an American blues rock band that was formed in the early 1970s by Don `` Sugarcane '' Harris . The band began with Paul Lagos on drums , Larry Taylor on bass and Randy Resnick on guitar . Resnick was at that time experimenting with a one and two handed tapping technique which later became a standard guitarist 's tool .
The group played small rooms in the Los Angeles area , such as the Troubadour and the Ash Grove , for several months .
While the band was searching for a record deal , Larry Taylor allegedly began to tire of Don 's constant lateness and irresponsibility and decided to continue his career with John Mayall . At the same time , Harvey Mandel , a Charlie Musselwhite , Canned Heat and Mayall alumnus , was brought in to beef up the accompaniment and to stimulate record label interest , as he already had a following from his Chicago blues days . To replace Taylor on bass , a relative newcomer , Victor Conte , was recruited from Common Ground , a funk band in Fresno that Resnick had played in . Conte went on to play in Tower of Power and with Herbie Hancock in his Monster Band .
Choice Cuts was the band 's only album , recorded live in Seattle in 1972 , but it was mostly unsuccessful . Allegedly because of Don 's unreliable nature , the band rarely rehearsed . Live performances included extended solos and improvised ensemble sections , and one song would often last 20 minutes or more . Various line-up changes took place until the band broke up a few years after releasing its first album .

A triple concerto ( Italian : Concerto triplo , German : Tripelkonzert ) is a concerto with three soloists . Such concertos have been composed from the Baroque period , including works by Corelli , Vivaldi , Bach and Telemann , to the 21st century , such as two works by Dmitri Smirnov . The most famous example is Beethoven 's Triple Concerto for violin , cello and piano . His combination of solo instruments , a piano trio , was often used also in later works .
History
Many works in the genre concerto grosso were composed for three solo instruments , including Corelli 's concerti grossi , Op . 6 , for a trio ( concertino ) of two violins and cello . 1714 . Antonio Vivaldi wrote several concertos for the same combination of instruments , published for example in L'estro armonico in 1711 . Based on Italian models , Johann Sebastian Bach composed concertos for multiple instruments , including his Fourth Brandenburg Concerto , BWV 1049 , with solo parts for violin and two recorders , his Fifth Brandenburg Concerto , BWV 1050 , featuring violin , flute and harpsichord , the Concerto , BWV 1044 , for the same soloists , and two concertos for three harpsichords and string orchestra .
Georg Philipp Telemann wrote 17 concertos for three instruments , many of them for two identical woodwind instruments , such as flutes or oboes , with a different third instrument such as violin or bassoon , others for three identical instruments , such as three violins , and for three different instruments , such as flute , violin and cello , published for example in his collection .
Baroque Era
Arcangelo Corelli 's twelve concerti grossi , Op . 6 , each of them for a soloist group ( concertino ) consisting of two violins and cello , were published posthumously in 1714 . After that publication , the concerto grosso qualification was used to indicate various types of baroque concertos with multiple soloists . Antonio Vivaldi 's L'estro armonico , published in 1711 , also contained a number of concertos for two violins and cello , however without concertos for multiple soloists being indicated as concerto grosso in this earlier publication . The difference in Corelli 's and Vivaldi 's approach towards concertos for multiple soloists , as well in style as regarding the name that was used for them , has been explained as relating to differences in music traditions in Rome ( where Corelli lived ) and Venice ( where Vivaldi lived ) . This did not prevent that later music historians would often , retro-actively , describe Vivaldi 's concertos for multiple instruments as concerti grossi . Whatever the naming and style differences , both Corelli and Vivaldi set two violins and a cello as the standard group of soloists for triple concertos of the first quarter of the 18th century .
Johann Sebastian Bach knew Italian concertos primarily through the Venetian composers , and thus also did not use the concerto grosso qualifier for his concertos for multiple soloists . Nonetheless also his concertos for multiple instruments were retro-actively called concerti grossi . Philipp Spitta , Bach 's 19th-century biographer , qualified these extant concertos for three soloists as concerti grossi :
Fifth Brandenburg Concerto , BWV 1050 ( solo parts for violin , flute , harpsichord ) .
Fourth Brandenburg Concerto , BWV 1049 ( solo parts for violin and two recorders ) .
Harpsichord concerto BWV 1057 , arranged after BWV 1049 , with the solo violin part replaced by harpsichord .
Triple Concerto , BWV 1044 , for the same soloists as the fifth Brandenburg Concerto .
Two concertos for three harpsichords and string orchestra :
No . 1 in D minor ( BWV 1063 ) , and ,
No . 2 in C major ( BWV 1064 ) .
Section 53 of the ( TWV ) lists 17 concertos for three soloists and orchestra by Georg Philipp Telemann . Most of these concertos are for two identical woodwind instruments , such as flutes or oboes , with a different third instrument such as violin or bassoon . Telemann also wrote triple concertos for three identical instruments and for three different instruments : for instance , his collections contain a concerto for three violins ( TWV 53 : F1 ) , and one for flute , violin and cello ( TWV 53 : A2 ) .
Classical and early Romantic Eras
The most popular triple concerto , commonly called Triple Concerto ( Tripelkonzert ) , is Beethoven 's Triple Concerto for violin , cello and piano .
Later developments
Triple concerto compositions
Examples of triple concertos include Johann Sebastian Bach 's Triple Concerto , BWV 1044 , with solo parts for violin , flute and harpsichord , Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart 's Concerto No . 7 for three pianos , Ludwig van Beethoven 's Triple Concerto for violin , cello and piano , and Dmitri Smirnov 's Triple Concerto No . 2 for violin , harp and double bass .
In the following table , the compositions are initially sorted by a year of composition or publication , followed by composer , title , the three instruments , the kind of orchestra , and notes , such as a link to a reference .

Cast
Reception
Lumière received critical acclaim . Critic Roger Ebert wrote positively of the film , commenting `` as the strands of [ Moreau 's ] story become clear and we begin to know the characters , the movie grows into a simple and strong emotional statement . ''
In a retrospective review , Richard Brody of The New Yorker wrote , Working with the cinematographer Ricardo Aronovich , [ Moreau ] develops a gliding , peering , shifting aesthetic to match the glossy surfaces with which she conveys shuddering depths of feeling . The camera roves around the actors , capturing the agitation within their controlled gestures , suggesting the elegance of leisure and luxury within which high adventures of passion , pleasure , and power—of self-creation and self-definition—play out .

Day Day Up ( ; pinyin : Tiāntiān xiàngshàng ) is a popular Chinese talk show broadcast on Hunan Television . The show is co-hosted by Wang Han ( 汪涵 ) , Da Zhangwei ( 大张伟 ) , Qian Feng ( 钱枫 ) , and Wang Yibo ( 王一博 ) . It has drawn great attention from the public , especially student groups and other young people , for its humor , style , and the public figures who appear as guests .
The Chinese title of the show `` tiāntiān xiàngshàng '' ( 天天向上 ) was inspired from a Chinese idiom coined by Mao Zedong , `` study hard and make progress every day '' ( 好好学习，天天向上 ; hǎohāo xuéxí , tiāntiān xiàngshàng ) which is literally translated as `` study well , move up day by day '' .
Background
The talk show was created by the original team behind `` More Talk More Happiness '' ( 越策越开心 ) . The impetus behind the creation of Day Day Up was that with the 'decline of traditional virtues and etiquette ' in China leading up to the 21st Century , the show would play an active role in conveying traditional Chinese values to viewers . This would allow people to enjoy learning about Chinese traditions , especially of the arrival of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games around the time of the show 's release . It employs both the young and the old for its humorous hosts in order to convey Chinese traditional values .
Pre-launch marketing
Prior to the release of the talk show , Hunan Television launched a series of marketing campaigns to increase the show 's exposure . This was done through multiple 'prequel shows ' ( 天天向上前传 or 'Day Day Up Prequels ' ) . Starting from 8 August 2008 , daily broadcasts of the show were shown to familiarise audience members with the format of the show and to raise interest towards the show 's topics of discussion . In each of these episodes , there would be an opening show , six classes , and finally a talk from the 'Headmaster ' ( host of the show ) .
New Format during COVID-19
With the coronavirus outbreak , as it is advisable to stay indoors to reduce the risks of being exposed to the virus , the show got creative by conducting a new format called `` Cloud Filming '' .

is a Sterling Professor of Immunobiology and Molecular , Cellular and Developmental Biology at Yale University . She is also a principal investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute . Her research interests include innate immunity , autophagy , inflammasomes , sexually transmitted infections , herpes simplex virus , human papillomavirus , respiratory virus infections , influenza infection , T cell immunity , commensal bacteria , COVID-19 and Long COVID .
Iwasaki was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2018 .
Biography
Iwasaki was born and raised in Iga , Japan by her father Hiroshi , a physicist , and mother Fumiko , who fought for women 's rights in the workplace . She has two sisters . After high school she moved to Toronto , Canada , where in 1994 , she received her bachelor 's degree in biochemistry and physics from the University of Toronto . She had hopes of becoming a mathematician or physicist like her father . However , her interests changed after taking an immunology class .
Iwasaki earned her doctoral degree in immunology from the University of Toronto in 1998 . Iwasaki did her Postdoctoral Fellow at the National Institutes of Health in the lab of mucosal immunologist Brian Lee Kelsall . In 2000 , she started her own lab at Yale University . In 2022 , Iwasaki was awarded a Sterling Professorship , the highest academic honor professors receive at Yale University .
Major contributions
While working on her PhD project of how DNA vaccines elicit an immune response , Iwasaki was among the first to show that antigen-presenting cells were in the blood , not the muscle . At the time scientists thought muscle cells were essential for alerting the immune system of foreign proteins , or antigens , coded for by the vaccines because the DNA vaccines work best when injected into the muscle .
Iwasaki 's research continues to focus on understanding innate immunity and how that information is used to produce protective adaptive immunity . Iwasaki and her team study immune responses to influenza in the lungs and herpes simplex virus in the genital tract . Overall , the goal is to design effective vaccines or microbiocides for the prevention of transmission of viral and bacterial pathogens . Iwasaki has developed a two-stage vaccination strategy called `` prime and pull '' that involves a conventional vaccine as a first step and then application of chemokines to the target tissue as a second step . Based on this strategy , Iwasaki has developed a vaccine that is currently in a clinical trial to treat women with precancerous lesions in the cervix to prevent cervical cancer . Serving on Yale University 's Science Strategy Committee , Iwasaki has advocated for harnessing the beneficial aspects of inflammation to `` combat widespread diseases like stroke , heart disease , and diabetes '' .
Building on her interests in immune responses to viral infection , Iwasaki has also led research into human rhinovirus and Zika virus . Iwasaki 's group was notably the first to create a mouse model of a vaginal Zika infection . Most recently , Iwasaki has delved into research looking at the immune response of COVID-19 patients and sex differences in SARS-CoV-2 infection . She is also examining the effects of Long COVID and other syndromes that occur following acute infections .
According to Google Scholar , one of her publications , `` Toll-like receptor control of the adaptive immune response , '' has been cited over 4,660 times as of July 2020 and was published in Nature Immunology in October 2004 . In January 2015 , one of Iwasaki 's studies was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . The study , `` Temperature-dependent innate defense against the common cold virus limits viral replication at warm temperature in mouse airway cells '' , investigates the relationship between temperature and immune responses .
Personal life

The Okhamandal State Railway was a metre gauge railway financed by the Okhamandal State .
History
The line between Kuranga and Arthara was sanctioned in 1913 . In 1918 , work on this line was stopped due to the war . In 1921 , the Gaekwar 's Baroda State Railway ( GBSR ) took over the management and operation of the Okhamandal State Railway . In 1922 the Kuranga–Okha Railway branch was opened which linked to the Okha Port Trust Railway . In 1923 the operation and maintenance of the Okhamandal State Railway was passed to the Jamnagar & Dwarka Railway . Saurashtra Railway came into being in April , 1948 with the amalgamation of a number of state railways which included Okhamandal State Railway .
Conversion to broad gauge
The railway was converted to broad gauge in 1984 .

Tris ( 2-aminoethyl ) amine is the organic compound with the formula N ( CH2CH2NH2 ) 3 . This colourless liquid is soluble in water and is highly basic , consisting of a tertiary amine center and three pendant primary amine groups . Abbreviated tren or TREN it is a crosslinking agent in the synthesis of polyimine networks and a tripodal ligand in coordination chemistry .
Tren is a C3-symmetric , tetradentate chelating ligand that forms stable complexes with transition metals , especially those in the 2+ and 3+ oxidation states . Tren complexes exist with relatively few isomers , reflecting the constrained connectivity of this tetramine . Thus , only a single achiral stereoisomer exists for [ Co ( tren ) X2 ] + , where X is halide or pseudohalide . In contrast , for [ Co ( trien ) X2 ] + five diastereomers are possible , four of which are chiral . In a few cases , tren serves as a tridentate ligand with one of the primary amine groups non-coordinated . Tren is a common impurity in the more common triethylenetetramine ( `` trien '' ) . As a trifunctional amine , tren forms a triisocyanate when derivatized with COCl2 .
It condenses with aldehydes to give imines .
N-methylated derivatives
The permethylated derivative of tren has the formula N ( CH2CH2NMe2 ) 3 . `` Me6tren '' forms a variety of complexes but , unlike tren , does not stabilize Co ( III ) . Related amino-triphosphines are also well developed , such as N ( CH2CH2PPh2 ) 3 ( m.p . 101-102 °C ) . This species is prepared from the nitrogen mustard N ( CH2CH2Cl ) 3 .
N , N , N-trimethyltren , N ( CH2CH2NHMe ) 3 is also available .
Safety considerations
( H2NCH2CH2 ) 3N , like other polyamines , is corrosive . It causes severe skin burns and eye damage , is harmful if inhaled due to the destruction of respiratory tissues , is toxic if swallowed , and can be fatal in contact with skin . Its median lethal dose is 246 mg/kg , oral ( rat ) , and 117 mg/kg , dermal ( rabbit ) . It is also combustible .

The white-chested tinkerbird ( Pogoniulus makawai ) is a species of bird in the Lybiidae family ( African barbets ) .
It is endemic to the Zambezian Cryptosepalum dry forests of Zambia . It is only known from the single type specimen , collected in 1964 by Jali Makawa , the field assistant and collector for Constantine Benson . Genetic evidence suggests that it may not a separate species , but instead be a population embedded within the yellow-rumped tinkerbird if it is not an aberrant individual .

Empathy is an instant messaging ( IM ) and voice over IP ( VoIP ) client which supports text , voice , video , file transfers , and inter-application communication over various IM communication protocols .
Empathy was created by forking the Gossip project started by Michael Hallendal , Richard Hult and later maintained by Martyn Russell . It was forked because there were disagreements amongst contributors about the backend at the time . It was initially completely XMPP based ( similar to Google Talk and Facebook 's chat implementations ) , but others wanted it to use the Telepathy stack . This led to the forking and new name Empathy .
Empathy also provides a collection of reusable graphical user interface widgets for developing instant messaging clients for the GNOME desktop . It is written as extension to the Telepathy framework , for connecting to different instant messaging networks with a unified user interface .
Empathy has been included in the GNOME desktop since its version 2.24 , in Ubuntu since version 9.10 ( Karmic Koala ) , and in Fedora since version 12 ( Constantine ) ; Empathy has replaced Pidgin as their default messenger application .
Empathy is no longer under development by the GNOME team .
Features
Empathy natively supports protocols , implemented in telepathy framework : XMPP ( including configuration for Facebook IM , Google Talk , though Gizmo5 , LiveJournal Talk , Nokia Ovi and other Jabber servers also supported ) , salut link-local XMPP for local network peer discovery , MSNP ( to Microsoft Messenger service as used by MSN Messenger or Windows Live Messenger ) , IRC and SIP . Additional protocols are supported with libpurple plug-in : OSCAR ( AIM/ICQ/MobileMe ) , Bonjour ( Apple 's implementation of Zeroconf ) , MySpaceIM , QQ , MXit , Novell GroupWise , YMSG , Gadu-Gadu , Lotus Sametime , SIMPLE , SILC , Zephyr .
Automatic features include auto away and extended away using gnome-screensaver , and auto re-connect using NetworkManager . One-on-one and group chats include smileys and spell checking . Conversation windows can be themed . Conversations can be logged , which can be viewed or searched , and prepended to new chats .
Additional features include :
Voice and video calls using SIP , MSNP and XMPP ( including support for Google Talk voice calls )
File transfer for XMPP
Geolocation of contacts ( can display contacts on a map )
Python bindings for Telepathy
Collaborative work using Tubes
Desktop sharing ( remote control )
Automatic configuration of Google Talk accounts ( with GNOME Online Accounts )
Reception
Ryan Paul at Ars Technica wrote in March 2009 , `` Empathy 's highly modular design , basic video chat capabilities , and excellent support for desktop integration are all major assets . '' He stated that it had `` improved '' , but it was `` rough around the edges '' , noting that at the time it had not yet `` been included in any major Linux distribution '' citing an Ubuntu usability study .
In November 2009 , after Empathy replaced Pidgin ( and Ekiga ) in Ubuntu 9.10 , Ryan wrote : `` Although Empathy has improved a lot over the past year , it 's still not stable . It crashed quite a few times during my tests and exhibited a number of other minor bugs . It 's adequate for basic chatting… '' . In his extended review of Ubuntu 9.10 , Igor ǈubunčić was terse about the switch from Pidgin to Empathy : `` Personally , I see no value in the change , especially since Empathy supports fewer networks . '' Tom 's Hardware reviewer Adam Overa referred to the switch to the `` much less popular and compatible Empathy client '' , as `` [ p ] robably the most controversial change in Ubuntu 9.10 '' , noting that a `` firestorm of debate has been raging over this topic among developers and users alike ever since the announcement to replace Pidgin was made… '' in 2009 .
In 2010 , Empathy was listed as one of `` 5 open source VoIP softphones to watch '' by Rodney Gedda of Computerworld magazine .
Security
Unlike clients supporting Off-the-Record Messaging ( OTR ) , Empathy lacks privacy and security facilities enforced through technical means . Empathy 's developers do not consider it within the client 's scope to implement OTR , while leaving the possibility of supporting potential future protocol-level encryption standards open .

The Zulu Congregational Church is a Congregational Church in South Africa .
History
The Zulu Congregational Church is one of the oldest African Ethiopian churches in South Africa , it was founded on the 23rd of March 1896 by Rt Rev Simungu Bafazini Shibe at Denver Zoar Umzumbe , KZN . It was formed as an independent from the previous American Zulu Mission at The Table Mountain Mission Station is situated forty miles northwest of Durban in Pietermaritzburg , was founded by American missionary , Samuel D. Marsh , in 1848 . Marsh was forced to abandon the station owing to ill health , and from 1850 it was administered by Jacob Dohne , formerly of the Berlin Missionary Society . In 1860 Dohne left the AZM to rejoin his parent society . From that date until 1896 , Table Mountain was without the services of a resident missionary . The Mission was limited by a perennial staff shortage throughout the nineteenth century , making it impossible to spare a missionary for an isolated station .
In 1875 African preacher Daniel Njaleki was appointed by the AZM to take charge of Table Mountain station . Njaleki began the construction of a church and by 1877 it had a membership of twenty-four .
In 1888 Njaleki left the mission after ill health and the mission applied for a replacement . Simungu Shibe was selected by the congregation and subsequently approved by the Mission . In 1896 , G.J . Pugh , the former treasurer of the NCU , became missionary-in-charge of Table Mountain . Upon his arrival Pugh asked for the Shibe 's removal . A large portion of the converts came out openly in support of Shibe .
At the pastors ' conference in June 1897 the pastors cited the self-support circular from America as justification for their demand that the congregation at Table Mountain be allowed to select its own ministers . Conflict erupted as the NCU wrote to the American Board of the Reserves requesting Shibe 's removal . The American Board refused to intervene . In February 1898 , Shibe travelled to Johannesburg , where along with Fokothi Makhanya of the Johannesburg Church , he was ordained pastor . John Langalibalele Dube helped Rev Shibe to form the ZCC . In 1917 one of the best Zulu Congregational Church preachers Gardner B. Mvuyane of the Johannesburg mission ceded from the Zulu Congregational Church and founded his own Church the African Congregational Church . In 1924 Shibe died
After Shibe 's death Rt Rev Aaron Mpanza took over as the president of the Church up until his death in 1956 under his leadership the church membership grew from 20 000 to over 50 000 members as it established missions in Natal , Transkei , Gazankulu and Kwa Ndebele , the church also adopted the new uniform which had the blue , white and black colors , hymn book and prayer books ( incwadi yombhedesho ) then Rt Rev A.P . Ntombela took over as the president of the church from 1955 until 1976 when Rt Rev H.J . Smith took over the leadership of the church until his death in 1995 . The church comprises three unions which are the Volunteers Union , W.C.U ( Women 's Union ) umanyano and the Mans Union . Today the church has over 80 000 members across South Africa as it found in the provinces of KwaZulu-Natal , Gauteng , Mpumalanga , Eastern Cape And North West .

Little Old New York is a 1940 American black-and-white historical drama from 20th Century Fox , produced by Darryl F. Zanuck , directed by Henry King , that stars Alice Faye , Fred MacMurray , and Richard Greene . The film is based on a play by Rida Johnson Young , which opened on Broadway on September 8 , 1920 , and starred Genevieve Tobin , Douglas Wood , and Donald Meek .
Little Old New York tells the story of the hardships of the engineer Robert Fulton in financing and building the first successful steam-powered ship in America , which would revolutionize river transportation and then ocean commerce around the world .
Plot
Engineer and inventor Robert Fulton ( Richard Greene ) comes to New York City in 1807 , where he meets tavern and innkeeper Pat O'Day ( Alice Faye ) . O'Day comes to strongly believe in Fulton and his dream after he lodges at her establishment . He pursues the investment capital he needs to build his visionary steam-powered ship .
O'Day 's longtime suitor , Charles Browne ( Fred MacMurray ) , opens his own shipyard to assist the dapper engineer in building his steamboat after Fulton receives initial financial investment from Chancellor Robert L. Livingstone ( Henry Stephenson ) . Additional funds are raised by O'Day ' from her business acquaintances . Fulton eventually acquires the remaining funds needed to complete his revolutionary paddle steamer .
After a shipwright named Regan ( Ward Bond ) has a run-in with Fulton , Regan attempts to turn every local deck hand and sail-powered passenger boat operator against the engineer , exploiting their fear of losing their livelihoods to a steam-powered vessel . In the end , despite adversity , bad luck , and additional interference from Regan , Fulton is able to complete the steamboat , now named Clermont , at Charles Brown 's shipyard . She is successfully launched on her first voyage , silencing the local critics and doubters who had previously labeled the venture `` Fulton 's Folly '' .

Production
This is one of Faye 's few nonmusical features , and her fans complained about her not singing in the film while it was still in production . A song was later added during an outdoor political rally set in a festive beer garden ; Faye 's participation in the added song proved minimal .
Both a 12-foot Clermont shooting miniature and a full-size mock-up were built in Hollywood for the Fox production . Both were based on the original full-sized Clermont replica built for the 1909 Hudson-Fulton Celebration , which was eventually broken up for scrap by her New York owners , a result of financial hardships brought on in the 1930s by the Great Depression .
North River Steamboat is the actual name of the historic steamboat upon which this film is based ; the vessel was never known as Clermont in its era .
Little Old New York is a sound remake of a silent film of the same title made in 1923 , directed by Sidney Olcott and starring Marion Davies , Stephen Carr , and J. M. Kerrigan .

Huggins-Stengel Field ( formerly known as Crescent Lake Field or Miller Huggins Field ) is a baseball field located within Crescent Lake Park in St. Petersburg , Florida , United States . It was originally constructed in 1925 as a Spring Training practice field for the New York Yankees and later hosted the New York Mets and Baltimore Orioles . The Yankees held spring training home games in St Petersburg at the field until their move to Al Lang Stadium in 1947 . The field is currently used for various high school and collegiate baseball games . The facility was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2019 .
History
Yankees era
1925-1942
The New York Yankees christened the facility in 1925 under manager Miller Huggins . Supposedly , they had moved from their previous home in New Orleans to keep Babe Ruth 's partying tendencies in check . After the passing of their great manager , the field was renamed Miller Huggins Field in 1931 . Featured during this time were Babe Ruth , Lou Gehrig , and Joe DiMaggio .
World War II
When World War II came to the forefront , travel restrictions became an issue , so the Yankees decided to practice in Atlantic City for the next few years , returning to Crescent Lake in 1946 .
1946-1961
After things had calmed from the war , the New York Yankees would return to Crescent Lake and continue their tenure in St. Petersburg , Florida . The Yankees played their home spring training games at Al Lang Stadium beginning in 1947 . During the majority of this time period , they were led by manager Casey Stengel , who would lead the club to many championships throughout the 1950s . Players during this era were Mickey Mantle , Roger Maris , Yogi Berra , and top Yankee prospect
John Malangone during 1955 spring training . The team moved its spring operations to Fort Lauderdale , Florida following the 1961 season .
Mets era
1962-1987
The newly created New York Mets would take over operations in Crescent Lake under their newly hired manager Casey Stengel , and in 1963 , the field was renamed Huggins-Stengel Field . Like their predecessors , they 'd practice in Crescent Lake , then play their games a couple miles down the road at Al Lang Stadium .
Orioles era
1992-1995
After a short absence of baseball , the field found a new tenant in the Baltimore Orioles in 1992 . Unfortunately , the facility was well past its prime at this point . Former Orioles pitcher Rick Sutcliffe noted that the locker room was reminiscent to that of a high school locker room . The team did not stay long , playing its last Spring there in 1995 , which would be the end of Spring Training baseball at Huggins-Stengel Field .
Folklore
Alligators
Story has it that during the first day of practice in 1925 , Babe Ruth refused to continue shagging fly balls because alligators had begun to sunbathe along the bank of the lake , which happened to be part of the outfield . Understandably , no player would want to have a close encounter with an alligator while picking up a baseball , so it is understood why he made this protest . In today 's rendition of the park , there is a wall separating players from the edge of the lake , reducing the risk of alligator attacks .
Home runs
Supposedly , only two players are known to have hit a home run that dropped straight into Crescent Lake : Babe Ruth of the Yankees and Dave Kingman of the Mets . This is considered an incredible feat because the lake lies over 500 feet from home plate .
Darrell Johnson , former teammate of Mickey Mantle 's , swears he saw Mickey routinely hit batting practice balls into the lake beyond the right field fence .
Darryl Strawberry earned the nickname `` Awesome Strawsome '' from teammate Lenny Dykstra after taking Bob Forsch deep for a home run to center field . This was notable due to the deep dimensions of the field and the height of the fence being around 15 feet .

People say that the field is haunted by the ghosts of past players .
Some people say that the day after Joe DiMaggio and Mickey Mantle died , a brown patch appeared in center field , where they both used to play .
Current use
The field no longer sees action from Major League Baseball , but still holds practices and games for high school and collegiate teams . There is not much seating , as there are currently only two sets of bleachers , but the nostalgic atmosphere makes a visit very worthwhile . The old clubhouses now serve as offices for TASCO , Teens Arts , Sports , and Cultural Opportunities , a local recreation program . While it is not considered a historical site , some remnants from the old clubhouse are still visible , including an old wooden locker and photographs .
The field has had some work done to it , but it still possesses its original dimensions and has not been raised or lowered like many renovated fields . It is essentially the same turf that the legends played on for the last 90 years .

The American Academy of Environmental Medicine ( AAEM ) , founded in 1965 as the Society for Clinical Ecology , is an international association of physicians and associated professionals interested in the clinical aspects of ecological or environmental illnesses , which is called clinical ecology . The academy aims for recognition of ecologic illness as a medical diagnosis .
Composed primarily of traditionally trained physicians from many specialties , the principal goals of the AAEM are physician education and the expansion of medical knowledge about often-overlooked effects on human health of environmental exposures encountered in everyday life .
The AAEM opposes the use of mercury-containing compounds in any product for human consumption , including mercury in vaccines . The AAEM also opposes water fluoridation and has called for a moratorium on food from genetically modified crops . The AAEM has been cited as an illegitimate organization by Quackwatch , for promoting the diagnosis of multiple chemical sensitivity .
History
The Society for Clinical Ecology was founded in 1965 , and inspired by the ideas of Theron Randolph . Clinical ecologists claimed that exposure to low levels of certain chemical agents harm susceptible people , causing multiple chemical sensitivity and other disorders .
Members of the academy may have a background in the field of allergy , and their theoretical approach is derived in part from non-standard concepts of allergic responses that were first articulated by Randolph in the 1960s .
In 1984 the Society changed its name to the American Academy of Environmental Medicine .
Objectives
Some of the objectives of the academy are :
To demonstrate that the concepts and techniques of environmental medicine are applicable to all fields of medical practice in which the physician is directly involved in patient care ,
To have the concept of optimal dose immunotherapy and the rotary diversified diet recognized as safe and effective , and
To promote education and research in environmental medicine .
The academy aims at expanding the understanding of interactions between human individuals and their environment , with the ultimate objective of improving the individual 's total health . The AAEM works towards the greater recognition , treatment and prevention of illnesses induced by exposures to various biological and chemical agents encountered in our environment , such as in air , food and water .
Legitimacy
Proponents of clinical ecology may claim cause-and-effect relationships or low-dose effects that are not generally accepted by toxicologists ( allergy , immunology and toxicology ) . Randolph 's theories about how allergies happen , which he promoted from the founding of the field , are the original basis for the suspicious attitude of mainstream medical , legal , and scientific experts towards clinical ecology as a whole . Clinical management of MCS is often considered to be inconsistent with science .
Quackwatch lists the American Academy of Environmental Medicine ( AAEM ) as a questionable organization , and its certifying board , the American Board of Environmental Medicine as a dubious certifying board . They are not recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties .
Accreditation
The academy is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education to provide continuing medical education .
Activities
The academy holds meetings and seminars and provides information on diagnosis and treatment of ecologic illnesses .
The academy publishes a directory of members , which includes the procedures they employ in their practices . Proceedings of seminars , including some tape recordings , also have been published . The academy publishes a quarterly newsletter , The Environmental Physician .

The moustached wren ( Pheugopedius genibarbis ) is a species of bird in the family Troglodytidae . It is found in Bolivia , Brazil , and Peru .
Taxonomy and systematics
The moustached wren was at one time treated as conspecific with the whiskered wren ( Pheugopedius mystaclais ) . It has four subspecies :
P. g. juruanus Ihering ( 1905 )
P. g. genibarbis Swainson ( 1837 )
P. g. intercedens Hellmayr ( 1908 )
P. g. bolivianus Todd ( 1913 )
Description
The moustached wren is long and weighs . The nominate adult has an olivaceous gray-brown crown and nape , bright chestnut back and rump , and a dull brown tail with narrow blackish bars . It has a white supercilium and eyering , a black stripe through the eye , gray-black cheeks streaked with white , a white moustachial stripe , and a black malar stripe . Its throat and upper chest are white , its lower chest buffy , and its flanks and belly deeper brown . Compared to the adult , the juvenile 's crown is browner , its back duller and less deeply chestnut , and it has less well defined facial markings and more diffuse bars on the tail .
P. g. juruanus is larger than the nominate and its underparts are paler . P. g. intercedens crown is less sooty and its underparts are duller than the nominate 's . P. g. bolivianus is similar to intercedens but its underparts are a deeper ochre compared to the nominate 's buff and it has more gray on the face .
Distribution and habitat
The moustached wren is found throughout the central and southern Amazon Basin . The subspecies are distributed thus :
P. g. juruanus , eastern Brazil from the Madeira River east to the Atlantic coast
P. g. genibarbis , the upper Amazon River drainage in eastern Peru , western Brazil as far east as the Madeira River , and probably northern and western Bolivia
P. g. intercedens , central Brazil 's Mato Grosso and Goiás states
P. g. bolivianus , northern Santa Cruz Department of eastern Bolivia
It inhabits forest edge , including along rivers , and favors dense stands of Bambusa bamboo . In elevation it ranges as high as in Bolivia but generally only from sea level to middle elevations .
Behavior
Feeding
The moustached wren forages low in vegetation and often in pairs . Though its diet has not been documented , it is probably mostly or entirely invertebrates .
Breeding
Four nests of the moustached wren found in Peru 's Manu National Park were domed or ball-like with a side entrance . They were all found with four eggs , in September and October . One adult incubated the eggs ; it was assumed to be the female . Nothing else is known about the species ' breeding phenology .
Vocalization
Both sexes of moustached wren sing `` a series of fast rollicking phrases '' . Their call is `` a whining 'jeeyr ' '' .
Status
The IUCN has assessed the moustached wren as being of The Least Concern . It is fairly common over its large range , its habitat is widespread and not excessively threatened , and it occurs in several protected areas .

Przemyslaus II of Cieszyn , also known as Primislaus II of Teschen or Przemko II ( , , ; 1422/25 – 18 March 1477 ) , was a Duke of Cieszyn ( Teschen , Těšín ) from 1431 , ruler over Bielsko and Skoczów ( from 1442 ) , Duke of half of both Duchy of Głogów ( Glogau , Hlohov ) and Duchy of Ścinawa from 1460 and from 1468 sole ruler over Cieszyn .
He was the third son of Duke Boleslaus I of Cieszyn by his second wife , Euphemia , daughter of Duke Siemowit IV of Masovia .
Life
After the death of his father in 1431 , Przemysław II ruled over all the Duchy together with his brothers as co-rulers , but under the tutelage of their mother . On 29 November 1442 the formal division of the Duchy took place between Bolesław I 's sons : Przemysław II took over Cieszyn ( but only nominally , because the power was taken by his older brother Wenceslaus I ) , Bielsko ( with his brother Bolesław II ) and Skoczów ( alone ) .
Przemysław II sought to actively interfere in political affairs . In 1443 he expressed his consent to the sale of the Duchy of Siewierz to Zbigniew Oleśnicki , Bishop of Kraków , in return for which he received from Wenceslaus I the amount of 500 pieces of silver . In 1447 , together with his brother Bolesław II , he participated in the Congress of Kraków , where he supported Poland in a dispute about Siewierz .
In 1447 , the death of his mother Euphemia finally enabled Przemysław II and his brother Bolesław II to move to their domains in Skoczów and Fryštát .
Bolesław II died in 1452 , leaving one son , Casimir II . Przemysław II took over the guardianship of his orphaned nephew .
Przemysław II supported his suzerain , the Bohemian king George of Podebrady and also maintained close ties with the Polish king Casimir IV Jagiellon , which was demonstrated , for example , in 1454 , when Przemysław II received in Cieszyn Princess Elisabeth of Austria , on her way to Kraków for her wedding to King Casimir IV . However , the good relations with Poland deteriorated after the dispute between Poland and Duke John IV of Oświęcim , which finally ended after a further agreement on 1 July 1457 in Kraków .
Three years later , Przemysław II was present at a meeting between the Kings of Poland and Bohemia in Bytom , where he served as conciliator . The next mediation took place on 9 June 1461 between John IV of Oświęcim and the King of Poland .
In 1460 Władysław , another of Przemysław II 's brothers , died without issue . In his will , he left his domains – half of both Głogów and Ścinawa – to his widow Margareta of Celje ( as her bequest , dower ) and Przemysław II , who actually took effective power over all the lands .
Przemysław II tried to get closer to Bohemian and Polish rulers and in 1462 in Głogów both kings met and negotiated the future of the Bohemian Kingdom . As a reward for his services , he received the town of Valašské Meziříčí in eastern Moravia , only during his lifetime .
In 1466 the prince took an active part in the expedition of George of Podebrady to Kłodzko ( Kladsko ) , causing tension between Cieszyn and the powerful Wrocław ( Breslau ) .
After the abdication of his brother Wenceslaus I in 1468 , Przemysław II could take power over Cieszyn , although the former duke in fact renounced on behalf of his nephew Casimir II .
In 1469 he took part in the election of Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus as ( anti ) King of Bohemia in Olomouc ( Olmütz ) , mainly thanks to the efforts of Pope Paul II and insurgent Bohemian Catholic nobility . For some time , Przemysław II went to Hungary and Bohemia , and even took part in the war against Corvinus ' enemies in the Upper Silesia . It appeared , however , that Matthias Corvinus did n't recompense Przemysław II for his support , but also tried depriving him of Cieszyn . In this situation , in 1471 Przemysław II joined the opposition against the King , supporting the Bohemian candidacy of Prince Vladislaus II Jagiellon , son of Casimir IV .
Trying to shift between Poland , Bohemia and Hungary , in 1473 Przemysław II supported Matthias Corvinus in his war against Duke Wenceslaus III of Rybnik . However , the common victory did n't improve his relations with the Hungarian monarch . In 1474 Wenceslaus I , the last surviving brother of Przemysław II , died without issue , allowing him to unify all their domains under his rule ( except Siewierz and Bytom , which were already sold ) . Przemysław II 's growing importance , however , did n't please Bohemian-Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus , who , during the meeting of Racibórz in 1475 , obtained from Casimir IV of Poland the guarantee that he could interfere without difficulties in the sovereignty over the Duchy of Teschen , threatening to completely deprive Przemysław II if he did n't pay a huge contribution . The Duke was saved from a final fall against the Hungarian-Polish army expedition , thanks to Jakub z Dębna , who supported the defense of Cieszyn . Przemyslaw II , however , had to agree to the seizure of half of both Głogów and Ścinawa in 1476 by King Matthias .
After , Przemysław II retained only the main town of Cieszyn and a few cities . He died soon afterwards , on 18 March 1477 and was buried in the Dominican church in Cieszyn . Without male issue , on his death he was succeeded by his nephew Casimir II , the only male member of the Cieszyn branch .
Marriage and issue
Around 1465 , Przemysław II married Anna ( b . 1450-1453 – d. by 14 September 1480 ) , daughter of Duke Bolesław IV of Warsaw . They had one daughter :
Hedwig of Cieszyn ( 1469 – 6 April 1521 ) ; married on 11 August 1483 to Stephen Zápolya , Lord of Trenčín . From this marriage were born four children , two sons and two daughters . The oldest son was János Zápolya , later King of Hungary , and the oldest of the daughters , Barbara Zápolya , was the first wife of Sigismund I the Old , King of Poland .

Composition
Honestly , Nevermind is a dance record driven by house and Baltimore club influences . The album includes elements of Jersey club , hard techno , R & B , amapiano , ballroom , and Drake 's traditional style of hip hop .
Critical reception
Honestly , Nevermind was met with generally positive reviews . At Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from professional publications , the album received an average score of 73 , based on 14 reviews , indicating `` generally favorable reviews '' . Aggregator AnyDecentMusic ? gave it 6.7 out of 10 , based on their assessment of the critical consensus .
In a positive review , Robin Murray of Clash called Honestly , Nevermind a `` puzzle that will take a long time to fully unlock '' and `` a devastating about-turn that will fascinate and frustrate in equal measure '' . Tim Sendra from AllMusic enjoyed the album , saying , `` Honestly , Nevermind is a welcome development in the Drake saga , a left turn off what was starting to seem like an endless stretch of trap-heavy highway . The destination is still sad and self-involved , but at least the scenery is colorful and never boring '' . The New York Timess Jon Caramanica wrote , `` A small marvel of bodily exuberance – appealingly weightless , escapist and zealously free . An album of entrancing club music , it 's a pointed evolution toward a new era for one of music 's most influential stars . It is also a Drake album made up almost wholly of the parts of Drake albums that send hip-hop purists into conniptions '' . Writing for Rolling Stone , Jeff Ihaza stated , `` The album achieves something mischievously unguarded : a collection of blissful dance tunes constructed for embrace and abandon . Drake takes a leap further into uncharted realms than any of his peers , offering a refreshing sign of what 's to come '' .
Vivian Medithi of HipHopDX said , `` He stopped making the Drake album we want him to make and made the Drake album Drake wants to make . Locked in with producers he trusts and letting his guard down , he sounds more focused and balanced than he has in years '' . Variety critic Alex Swhear said , `` As a standalone Drake album , it 's deeply refreshing , and a dose of vibrant pop likely to reverberate through the remainder of the summer '' . Louis Pavlakos of Exclaim ! said , `` Hints of the album 's atypicality are apparent from its opening minutes , for better or worse . `` Falling Back '' makes for a questionable lead-off , as Drake 's falsetto has never been particularly strong , but Honestly , Nevermind rarely falters from there '' .
In a lukewarm review , Pitchforks Alphonse Pierre wrote , `` A breezy Drake dance album sounds great in concept , but the half-measure house beats and lackluster songwriting keep it from really popping off '' . In his review , Alexis Petridis of The Guardian states , `` The Canadian superstar 's new album is surprisingly full of house music , but his passive-aggressive complaints get dull '' . NME critic Kyann-Sian Williams said , `` The Canadian 's latest release surprises in many ways , ditching bland trap for house beats and some daring , if somewhat mixed , vocal takes '' . In a more negative review , David Smyth of Evening Standard opined that Honestly , Nevermind felt like `` a minor work '' within Drake 's discography , going on to say that `` [ Drake ] sounds like he is n't trying very hard '' .
In popular culture
The song `` Texts Go Green '' was used by Google in an Android advertisement to call on Apple Inc. to adopt Rich Communication Services ( RCS ) , in reference to the song 's premise of iPhone users being blocked on iMessage .
Commercial performance
Honestly , Nevermind debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 with 204,000 album-equivalent units , including 11,000 pure album sales .

Timothy Milledge Hankinson ( February 18 , 1955 – September 22 , 2022 ) was an American soccer coach . He initially coached American college teams , before becoming head coach in Major League Soccer , as well as managing teams in Iceland , India , and Jamaica .
Early career
Hankinson was born in New York City on February 18 , 1955 . His father , Richard `` Dick '' Hankinson , was a pianist ; his mother , Nelle `` Pokey '' Hankinson ( née Rahm ) , was `` an actress in the early days of television '' . Hankinson 's career as a player began at age 5 as a kindergarten student at St. David 's School . The school had a relationship with a German soccer coach who taught the students how to play the game on the grassy spaces at nearby Central Park . Seeing the coach perform a simple trick with a ball intrigued the young player and a lifelong love of the game began . Following his 8th grade graduation from St. David 's , Hankinson continued his education and soccer playing in Upstate New York at The Storm King School , then at the University of South Carolina ( USC ) . While a college student , he earned his USSF C and B Licenses , already knowing his future would lead to a career in coaching .
Coaching career
Collegiate soccer
After graduating from South Carolina in 1979 , Hankinson 's career as a head coach began at Oglethorpe University . After one season that ended with his team making an appearance as NAIA District Finalists , he moved on to the men 's head coach post at Alabama A & M . In his two seasons at the helm , Hankinson 's sides compiled an impressive 37–5–4 ( W-L-D ) record and made a pair of appearances in the NCAA Men 's Soccer Championship finishing 3rd in 1980 and 2nd in 1981 . Hankinson soon moved on to DePaul University for the 1982 and 1983 seasons where he helped transition the school 's men 's soccer program into the NCAA Division I ranks . He then took a year off before joining Syracuse University as their men 's head coach in 1985 . From 1985 to 1990 , Hankinson 's teams were 69–40–18 ( W-L-D ) including a Big East Conference championship in 1985 . Their performance also yielded individual recognition for Hankinson as he was named Big East Conference Coach of the Year for 1986 , becoming the first Syracuse head coach to win the award .
Professional soccer
After a fair amount of success in the collegiate game , Hankinson turned to coaching professional players and from 1990 to 1991 was in the head coach role at UMF Tindastóll in Iceland 's Úrvalsdeild ( First Division ) . He was the first US national to coach in Iceland . He later returned home to the US and in 1992 helped found the Charleston Battery club which competed in the USL ( known then as the United States Interregional Soccer League ( USISL ) ) . While head coach and general manager , Hankinson 's squads reached the league playoffs in 1993 , then returned again in 1994 where they advanced to the semi-finals . Hankinson was consequently named USISL Coach of the Year in 1994 .
Hankinson then spent the 1995 season as the general manager of the Raleigh Flyers before joining the nascent MLS as their first Director of Player Development . From 1996 to 1998 Hankinson led scouting and player development as the league worked to establish itself as both a viable enterprise and the top level of soccer in the US . During this same period , Hankinson was the head coach for Project-40 where he worked with future MLS stars such as Ben Olson and soon-to-be US national team regulars like Tim Howard .
In 1998 , Hankinson transitioned to become head coach of the now-defunct Tampa Bay Mutiny . The franchise won 39 games from 1998 to 2000 and made playoff appearances in 1999 and 2000 before the doors were closed following the 2001 season as part of the MLS contraction that downsized the league from 12 teams to 10 . But by then , Hankinson had already departed for Denver to take the top job at Colorado Rapids in late 2000 . Hankinson 's teams won 40 games during his time with the club and reached the playoffs three consecutive seasons between 2002 and 2004 . This period also included a streak of 31 home games where the team lost just one game . In late 2004 , the Rapids were sold by AEG to KSE and Hankinson was let go along with the bulk of the Rapids front office to make way for the new owner 's leadership team .
Seeking a change and looking to take his coaching to the next level , Hankinson decamped for Brazil and a stint with Serie A ( First Division ) Figueirense FC where he worked as a guest coach , learning Brazilian training methods and deepening his knowledge of the game .
Return to amateur soccer
Choosing to stay in Latin America , in 2006 he joined the Guatemala Football Federation as the U-17 men 's head coach where he led the side through International `` friendlies '' and a competitive , but ultimately unsuccessful , 2007 World Cup qualifying campaign . Hankinson once again looked to the US for his next opportunity and returned to his collegiate roots , and Colorado , in taking the reins at Fort Lewis College . In just two seasons ( 2007 and 2008 ) , his teams went 32–8–4 ( W-L-D ) , won the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference ( RMAC ) twice , advanced to the NCAA Division II Tournament twice and , at times , were nationally ranked # 1 . For his team 's 2008 run , Hankinson was named 2008 RMAC Co-Coach of the Year .
India
In mid-2009 , Hankinson went abroad for the third time to become the `` chief coach '' of Salgaocar SC in Vasco , Goa , India . However , his time with the club was cut short after just six months and he parted with the club early in 2010 .
Youth soccer
After a brief period away from soccer , Hankinson went back to the US and coached youth teams . In late 2010 , he joined the staff of Broomfield Soccer Club as its Director of Coaching , citing the club 's location in the familiar surroundings of Colorado , close proximity to family and the opportunity to `` give back to the game '' at the most fundamental level as key criteria in his decision to take the post .
Return to the pro game
Following a productive year with Broomfield SC , Hankinson was appointed the first head coach for San Antonio Scorpions of the North American Soccer League ( NASL ) on September 14 , 2011 . His first task was to lead the assembly of their new professional side and take them into league play for the 2012 season . During their inaugural season the Scorpions achieved a 13W-8D-7L to win the regular season title , but bowed out of the playoffs in the semi-finals . The 2013 season had a much bumpier ride and following a 8W-3D-11L start , Hankinson and the Scorpions parted ways August 27 , 2013 . After a two-year sabbatical , Hankinson joined Montego Bay United F.C . for a short , but successful stint , compiling a 7W-4D-2L record during the first half of their 2015–16 season from August through mid-November when Hankinson was lured back to the NASL and announced as the new head coach of Indy Eleven on December 2 , 2015 .
After leading the Eleven to the 2016 NASL Spring Season Championship with an unbeaten Spring season , and a berth in the 2016 NASL Championship Final , Hankinson was named the NASL Coach of the Year . Hankinson 's contract was not renewed after the Fall 2017 season , which the Eleven finished in last position with a 3–4–9 record , and 7–12–13 over the entire year .
Personal life
Hankinson had one child , Bryan .
Hankinson died on September 22 , 2022 . He was 67 , and suffered from stage 4 adenocarcinoma prior to his death .

Jake Thomas Mangum ( born March 8 , 1996 ) is an American professional baseball outfielder in the New York Mets organization . He played college baseball for the Mississippi State Bulldogs .
Early life and high school
Mangum was born in Flowood , Mississippi and grew up in nearby Pearl , Mississippi and attended Jackson Preparatory School . While playing for the Patriots Mangum was a member of three consecutive state championship teams in baseball and was named a Louisville Slugger All-American in 2013 and 2015 and Perfect Game All-American in 2013 , 2014 and 2015 and Mississippi Association of Independent Schools ( MAIS ) first team All-State in 2014 and 2015 . As a senior , Mangum was named the MIAS AAA , Division I Player of the Year after hitting .504 with 46 runs scored and 41 RBIs and compiling an 8-0 record with four saves , 66 strikeouts , and a 1.48 ERA in 52 innings pitched . Mangum originally committed to play college baseball at the University of Alabama , his father 's alma mater , over offers from Ole Miss and Auburn . However , he ultimately de-committed from Alabama and instead chose to play for Mississippi State .
College career
As a freshman in 2016 , Mangum led the Southeastern Conference ( SEC ) and finished 7th in the NCAA with a .408 batting average along with 84 hits , one home run , 40 runs scored and 28 RBIs . He was named the SEC Freshman of the Year and first team All-SEC , as well as Freshman All-America by the National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association ( NCBWA ) and Baseball America . Mangum was also named second team All-America by the NCBWA , third team All-America by the American Baseball Coaches Association ( ABCA ) , and was the first freshman to be awarded the C Spire Ferriss Trophy as the top collegiate baseball player in the State of Mississippi . During the summer of 2016 , he played for the Bourne Braves of the Cape Cod Baseball League , batting .300 with nine RBIs and 11 stolen bases in 35 games and was named to the Cape Cod All-Star team .
As a sophomore , Mangum slashed .324/.380/.385 in 65 games with 90 hits , 51 runs scored , 26 RBIs and 14 stolen bases and was named second team All-SEC . In addition to playing in the outfield , Mangum also pitched for the Bulldogs and posted a 2-1 record with a 6.46 ERA in six appearances ( five starts ) and a save in his only relief appearance . Despite breaking his left hand sliding into third base in early April in a game against Kentucky , Mangum continued to play the rest of the season although he could not bat right handed and his batting average fell dramatically . Mangum was selected in the 30th round ( 902nd overall ) of the 2017 Major League Baseball draft by the New York Yankees following the season but opted to return to Mississippi State for his junior year . Following the 2017 season , he played a second summer in the Cape Cod League with the Hyannis Harbor Hawks and was named to the All-Star team for a second straight year .
In his junior season in 2018 , Mangum led the SEC with 101 hits ( 5th in the NCAA ) and 22 doubles ( 18th ) in an NCAA-leading 288 at bats while hitting .351 . He was named first team All-SEC and to the SEC All-Defensive team and Rawlings Division I Gold Glove Team as the Bulldogs advanced to the 2018 College World Series , making it to the semifinals before losing to eventual champion Oregon State . He was selected with the 950th pick in the 32nd round of the 2018 MLB Draft by the New York Mets but again decided to return to school , reportedly turning down a $ 300,000 signing bonus .
On April 26 , 2019 Mangum passed Eddy Furniss as the all-time hits leaders in SEC history with his 353rd career hit . He set the MSU single season hit record with 108 in his final career game against Louisville in the College World Series . He was again named first team All-SEC and was awarded the Ferriss Trophy , becoming the first player to receive it twice . He was also named third team All-America by Collegiate Baseball Newspaper , becoming the second player in program history to be named an All-American in three different seasons after Rafael Palmeiro . Mangum finished his collegiate career with a school and conference record 383 hits ( fourth in NCAA history ) and at bats with 1,074 , as well as school records for games played ( 262 ) and doubles ( 73 ) and finished second with 229 runs , third with 507 total bases , fourth with 56 stolen bases and tied for the 10th-highest career batting average at .357 . Mangum was selected by the Mets again in the 2019 MLB Draft in the fourth round ( 118th overall ) . Following the Bulldogs loss to Louisville in the College World Series , Mangum made an impassioned appeal for the NCAA to allow programs to pay a third coach and to raise the scholarship limit beyond the current allowance of 11.7 , revealing that he chose to give up his scholarship and play as a walk-on for his final two seasons so that Mississippi State could use the scholarship money elsewhere .
Professional career
Mangum signed with the Mets on June 24 , 2019 for a signing bonus $ 20,000 which was well below the slated bonus amount of $ 487,900 for his slot . He was assigned to the Brooklyn Cyclones of the Class A Short Season New York–Penn League to begin his professional career . In his first professional season , Mangum batted .247 with 45 hits , 29 runs scored , 18 RBI and a team-leading 17 stolen bases in 53 games .
Mangum returned to Brooklyn , now the Mets ' High-A affiliate , to begin the 2021 season before being promoted to the Double-A Binghamton Rumble Ponies on May 22 . Over 84 games between the two teams , he slashed .285/.337/.454 with nine home runs , 47 RBI , and 14 stolen bases .
Mangum was named to the Mets ' 2022 spring training roster as a non-roster invitee . He was assigned to Binghamton at the start of the season . Mangum batted .283 in 31 games before he was promoted to the Triple-A Syracuse Mets .
Personal life
Mangum is the son of former Alabama and Chicago Bears defensive back John Mangum and the nephew of former Carolina Panthers tight end Kris Mangum . His grandfather , John `` Big John '' Mangum Sr. , played college football at Ole Miss and Southern Mississippi before playing for the Boston Patriots of the American Football League . Because of Magnum 's success at Mississippi State he was nicknamed the Mayor of Starkville .

Michael Rose ( born 11 July 1957 ) is a Grammy award-winning reggae singer from Jamaica . He is known for a successful tenure with Black Uhuru from 1977 to 1984 , and he has worked regularly with Dennis Brown , Big Youth , The Wailers , Gregory Isaacs , Sly and Robbie , and others . He has also released more than twenty solo albums .
Career
Rose started his recording career as a solo artist for record producers Yabby You and Niney the Observer . He joined Black Uhuru in 1977 after the departure of Don Carlos and Garth Dennis . As lead singer and a primary songwriter , Rose led Black Uhuru to international recognition in the early 1980s , and the group won the first-ever Grammy Award for reggae in 1985 for the album Anthem .
Rose left Black Uhuru in 1985 after falling out with group founder Duckie Simpson , and retired to the Blue Mountains in Jamaica to start a coffee farm . He released a string of singles in Jamaica , but nothing much was heard of him outside the island until 1989 , when he was signed to RCA and released the strongly pop influenced album Proud in Europe and Japan . The deal with RCA was short-lived however , and Rose returned to Jamaica to record a new string of Sly and Robbie produced singles . He also recorded for other producers but the only albums during this period were the Japan only releases Bonanza ( 1991 ) and King Of General ( 1992 ) . The Sly and Robbie produced singles were eventually released on the vinyl only Sly And Robbie presents : Mykall Rose – The Taxi Sessions in 1995 also saw his American debut as a solo artist with the album Michael Rose on Heartbeat Records . The single `` Short Temper '' reached No . 2 on the Gavin reggae chart .
In the period 1995–2004 Heartbeat Records released a total of nine albums including Party in Session : Live and a compilation entitled Happiness : The Best Of Michael Rose . Next to these albums , a great amount of different recordings appeared on dozens of Jamaican vinyl singles and several albums , including `` Last Chance '' which was No . 1 on the UK reggae charts for several weeks . He also recorded `` Michael Rows the Boat Ashore '' in 2001 .
In 2002 , Rose recorded two albums : Babylon 9/11 Tip Of The Iceberg ( released on Love Injection in 2004 ) , and a yet untitled album for African Star records . In August 2002 , Rose was reported arrested in Miami Airport by U.S . Marshals in a case of mistaken identity . Although he was released , it resulted in Rose losing his U.S. work permit .
Rose re-joined Black Uhuru in February 2004 , and performed several concerts in Jamaica and Europe with the group . They also released a Jamaican single `` Dollars '' and reportedly have recorded a yet untitled and unreleased album . Yet , in spite of his reunion with Black Uhuru , Rose still tours , records and releases material as a solo artist . In 2007 he recorded the number 1 single `` Shoot Out '' for producer John John . His latest album was released early 2008 on the Rhythm Club record label , entitled Great Expectations .
In August 2019 he released the album Ska Ska Ska , his first ska album , recorded with Venezuelan musician/producer Dario Amarado . Rose was also an inaugural member of the Independent Music Awards ' judging panel to support independent artists .
Name spelling
From about 1991 onwards , his name was often spelled 'Mykal Rose ' , which Rose has said is the Ethiopian way of spelling his name , which made it feel closer to home . Other spellings found on certain releases include 'Mykal Roze ' , 'Mikal Rose ' , 'Michael Roze ' and so forth . This may have caused difficulty in tracking down releases .

The Atba-e-Malak community are a branch of Musta'ali Isma'ili Shi ' a Islam that broke off from the mainstream Dawoodi Bohra after the death of the 46th Da ' i al-Mutlaq , under the leadership of Abdul Hussain Jivaji in 1840 . They are based in Nagpur in India . There are several hundred followers of this branch of Musta'ali Isma'ili Shi ' a Islam . They have further split into two more branches :
Atba-e-Malak Badar – The current leader is Maulana Muhammad Amiruddin Malak Saheb
Atba-e-Malak Vakil – Their current leader is Moulana Tayyeb Saheb .
Atba-e-Malak Vakil
The Atba-e-Malak Vakil is Muslim-Shia-Ismaili-Tayyebi-Dawoodi-Malak-Vakil Bohra sect that firmly believes in the tradition of Nass governing the appointment of Saheb-e-Amar ( spiritual successor ) continuing the succession ( Silsila ) . As per the principle of Nass , neither Imam nor Da ' i al-Mutlaq can pass away without appointing their successor but after untimely and sudden demise of the 46th Da ' i al-Mutlaq Syedna Mohammad Badruddin saheb , due to uncertainty and unawareness of Nass , the community divided in 2 sections . One section believed that Nass got disbanded and the other larger section of followers accepted then Mazoon al-Da'wat Abdul Kader Najmuddin saheb as 47th Da ' i al-Mutlaq as guided by Sheikh Abdeali Imaduddin ( the teacher and close aide of Abdul Kader Najmuddin saheb and later his Mukaashir al-Da'wat ) and fell off from the true Silsila ( Succession ) that was already established as the succession of four Mumalikin saheb ( hidden successors - the seclusion was necessary to guard the Amar in then difficult times ) , last one being Moulana Adamji Tayyebji saheb in Mumbai followed by Moulana Malak ( Abdul Hussein Jivaji ) saheb who appointed Moulana Abdul Qadir Ebrahimji saheb as his Mansoos ( successor ) or Vakil ( the one who advocates his succession or roots / acts for his principal ) that identifies his followers as Atba-e-Malak Vakil .
Their current spiritual lord / Imam is Moulana Tayyeb saheb bin Moulana Razzak saheb . Qur'an and Nasihat ( Scriptures written by Syedi Sadiqali during the period of 42nd Da ' i al-Mutlaq Syedna Yusuf Najmuddin saheb and 44th Da ' i al-Mutlaq Syedna Mohammed Ezzuddin saheb ) are main religious scriptures of Atba-e-Malak Vakil sect . They follow all the 7 pillars of Islam - Taharat , Namaz , Zakat , Roza , Hajj , Jihad ( Spiritual struggle ) and Walayah ( Arabic : وِلاية ) in the same order as per Shia Ismaili Tayyebi beliefs in its batini ( in essence ) meaning .
Based on their fundamental beliefs , Saheb-e-Amar ( spiritual successor ) reinforces and connects with his ruhani hasab-nasab ( spiritual lineage ) as it happened in the past with every Nabi , Imam or Da ' i al-Mutlaq . This is not to be confused with family lineage to drive material objectives for power , strength or money as it happens in most kingdoms , business empires or political outfits on contrary Saheb-e-Amar spends most of their life and efforts for the single most important responsibility of preaching , practicing , guarding , upholding and spreading humanitarian values and causes which has always been full of difficulties and worldly troubles in every generation . The transfer of `` Amar '' ( Spiritual succession ) from father to son must be followed in essence ( Batini ) and not in superficial or apparent ( Zahiri ) sense . Like in real world too , the teacher 's child may not end up as a teacher though the probability of teacher 's child ending up as teacher may be high . Saheb-e-Amar is representative of Al-mighty GOD on earth and exhibits divine qualities favoring ( Ehsaan إحسان ) the one and all to experience the presence of divinity on earth . Therefore , in other words , the presence of divine qualities proves the Nass ( divine appointment ) on the Mansoos ( spiritual successor ) and that 's why in all the sacred scriptures , it is mentioned that the body changes but the soul remains and to be fortunate to live with such lord is living in Jannat ( Heaven / Paradise ) where the river of water , milk , wine and honey flows as per holy Qur'an ( 47:15 ) . `` ( Here is ) a Parable of the Garden which the righteous are promised : in it are rivers of water incorruptible ; rivers of milk of which the taste never changes ; rivers of wine , a joy to those who drink ; and rivers of honey pure and clear . In it there are for them all kinds of fruits ; and Grace from their Lord . ( Can those in such Bliss ) be compared to such as shall dwell for ever in the Fire , and be given , to drink , boiling water , so that it cuts up their bowels ( to pieces ) ? '' - YUSUF ALI

Bull Alley Street ( ) is a street in the medieval area of Dublin , Ireland .
Location
Bull Alley Street runs from Bride Street to the east to Patrick Street to the west , and parallel with Bride Road . Along the southern side of the street is St Patrick 's Park .
History
This street first appears on maps of Dublin in 1680 as Bull Alley . It was part of the parish of St Nicholas Within . It is probable that the Street 's name is derived from the name of a tavern or inn with a sign of a bull . In the late 1800s , the street had a large number of butchers , victuallers and other jobs associated with the meat industry .
In the 1900s , the Dublin Corporation built a housing scheme on Bull Alley Street , designed by C. J. McCarthy . It was completed in 1904 , and complemented the Iveagh Trust scheme adjacent . The Iveagh Trust scheme consists of eight blocks of 213 apartments built between 1901 and 1905 . Both schemes replaced slums which were razed for the construction . Most of these buildings are Art Nouveau in style . The Play Centre built by the Trust in 1915 , now Liberties College , was designed by L. A. McDonnell . The slums along the southern side of the Street were cleared to make way for St Patrick 's Park , as the slums had reached right up the side of St Patrick 's Cathedral .

Susan Lisa Rosenberg ( born October 5 , 1955 ) is an American activist , writer , advocate for social justice and prisoners ' rights . From the late 1970s into the mid-1980s , Rosenberg was active in the far-left revolutionary May 19th Communist Organization ( `` M19CO '' ) which , according to a contemporaneous FBI report , `` openly advocate [ d ] the overthrow of the U.S. Government through armed struggle and the use of violence '' . M19CO provided support to an offshoot of the Black Liberation Army , including in armored truck robberies , and later engaged in bombings of government buildings , including the 1983 Capitol bombing .
After living as a fugitive for two years , Rosenberg was arrested in 1984 while in possession of a large cache of explosives and firearms , including automatic weapons . She had also been sought as an accomplice in the 1979 prison escape of Assata Shakur and in the 1981 Brink 's robbery that resulted in the deaths of two police officers and a guard , although she was never charged in either case . Convicted after a trial on the weapons and explosives charges , Rosenberg was sentenced to 58 years ' imprisonment .
She spent 16 years in prison , during which she became a poet , author , and AIDS activist . Her sentence was commuted to time served by President Bill Clinton on January 20 , 2001 , his final day in office .
Early life
Rosenberg was born into a middle-class Jewish family in Manhattan . Her father was a dentist and her mother a theatrical producer . She attended the progressive Walden School and later went to Barnard College at Columbia University . She left Barnard and became a drug counselor at Lincoln Hospital in The Bronx , eventually becoming licensed in the practice of Chinese medicine and acupuncture . She also worked as an anti-drug counselor and acupuncturist at health centers in Harlem , including the Black Acupuncture Advisory of North America .
Activism and imprisonment
In an interview with the radio show Democracy Now , Rosenberg said that she was `` totally and profoundly influenced by the revolutionary movements of the '60s and '70s '' . She became active in feminist causes , and worked in support of the Puerto Rican independence movement and the fight against the FBI 's COINTELPRO program . Rosenberg joined the May 19th Communist Organization , a female-led clandestine group working in support of the Black Liberation Army and its offshoots ( including assistance in armored truck robberies ) , the Weather Underground and other revolutionary organizations .
Rosenberg was charged with a role in bombings at the U.S. Capitol , the U.S. National War College and the New York Patrolmen 's Benevolent Association building , but these charges were dropped as part of a plea deal by other members of her group .
Arrested in November 1984 for possession of over 750 lbs of explosives , after two years underground following the Brink 's robbery , Rosenberg was convicted in March 1985 by a federal jury in New Jersey and given a 58-year-sentence . Supporters said this was sixteen times the national average for such offenses . Her lawyers contended that , had the case not been politically charged , Rosenberg would have received a five-year sentence .
Rosenberg was one of the first two inmates of the High Security Unit ( HSU ) , an isolation unit in the basement of the Federal Correctional Institution ( currently the Federal Medical Center ) in Lexington , Kentucky . Allegations were made that the unit was an experimental underground political prison that practiced isolation and sensory deprivation . The women were subject to 24-hour camera surveillance and frequent strip searches , and were given only limited access to visitors or to exercise . After touring the unit , the American Civil Liberties Union denounced it as a `` living tomb '' , and Amnesty International called it `` deliberately and gratuitously oppressive '' . After a lawsuit was brought by the ACLU and other organizations , the unit was ordered closed by a federal judge in 1988 and the prisoners transferred to regular cells .
Rosenberg was transferred to various prisons around the country , including FCI Coleman , Florida , FCI Dublin , California and , finally , FCI Danbury , Connecticut . In prison , she devoted herself to writing and to AIDS activism , and obtained a master 's degree from Antioch University . Speaking at a 2007 forum , Rosenberg said that writing `` became the mechanism by which to save my own sanity '' . She added that she began writing partly because the intense isolation of prison was threatening to cut her off completely from the real world and that she did not want to lose her connection to that world .
Release
Rosenberg 's sentence was commuted by President Bill Clinton on January 20 , 2001 , his last day in office , to the more than 16 years ' time served . Her commutation produced a wave of criticism by police and New York elected officials .
After her release , Rosenberg became the communications director for the American Jewish World Service , an international development and human rights organization , based in New York City . She also continued her work as an anti-prison activist , and taught literature at John Jay College of Criminal Justice , in Midtown Manhattan , New York City . After teaching for four semesters there as an adjunct instructor , the CUNY administration , responding to political pressure , forced John Jay College to end its association with Rosenberg , and her contract with the school was allowed to expire without her being rehired .
In 2004 , Hamilton College offered her a position to teach a for-credit month-long seminar , `` Resistance Memoirs : Writing , Identity and Change '' . Some professors , alumni and parents of students objected and as a result of the ongoing protests , she declined the offer .
As of 2020 , Rosenberg serves as vice chair of the board of directors of Thousand Currents , a non-profit foundation that raises funds and provides institutional support for grassroots groups , particularly in the Global South .
Writing
In 2011 , Rosenberg published a memoir of her time in prison called , An American Radical : A Political Prisoner In My Own Country . Kirkus Reviews said of the book , `` Articulate and clear-eyed , Rosenberg 's memoir memorably records the struggles of a woman determined to be the agent of her own life . ''

`` Hotel Room Service '' is a song by American rapper Pitbull released as the third single from his fourth album , Pitbull Starring in Rebelution . It was released to both iTunes and mainstream radio on June 16 , 2009 . The song peaked at number eight on the US Billboard Hot 100 , making it his second top 10 hit following `` I Know You Want Me ( Calle Ocho ) '' .
The song samples `` Push the Feeling On '' by Nightcrawlers and interpolates lyrics from Jay-Z 's `` I Just Wan na Love U '' ( `` Gim me that sweet , that nasty , that gushy stuff '' ) , The Notorious B.I.G . 's `` Nasty Girl '' ( `` Put them fingers in your mouth / Open up your blouse / Pull that g-string down south '' ) , and Sugarhill Gang 's `` Rapper 's Delight '' ( `` We at the hotel , motel , Holiday Inn '' ) . It also references `` Whatever You Like '' by T.I . when it says `` And like T.I . 's 'Whatever You Like ' '' .
On September 16 , the official remix to `` Hotel Room Service '' was released , which features Pussycat Dolls lead singer Nicole Scherzinger .
Music video
The song 's official music video was released on August 10 , 2009 to Pitbull 's YouTube channel .
Jim Jonsin , Sophia Del Carmen and Feisty from For the Love of Ray J make cameo appearances in the video as does Nayer and Sagia Castañeda , who appeared in the `` I Know You Want Me ( Calle Ocho ) '' video as well . The video features Pitbull with models Elizabeth Mendez , Cassie Codi , Lisa Morales , Anya Gonzalez , and Kimbella Vanderhee .
A version of the song titled `` Super Clean Edit '' ( 3:58 ) was released to radio stations and features alternate lyrics in place of the 'egg whites ' line .
undone :
Yo ' man just left , I 'm the doctor tonight . Check up right ! Oh , you are the healthy type , well I'mma give you just what you like ...
This version also replaces the outro in which Pitbull exclaims 'Mujeres ! ' to an English translation 'All my women ! '
The video was also released onto Pitbull 's official VEVO channel on November 14 , that year . It has received almost 300 million views .
Critical reception
The song received generally favorable reviews , with David Jeffries from AllMusic saying , `` nothing ... could fill a dancefloor as quickly as the ... stunner ... 'Hotel Room Service ' , which triple mashes an old-school hit ( 'Rapper 's Delight ' ) , a 2 Live Crew classic ( 'One and One ' ) , plus a house music giant ( the Nightcrawlers ' 'Push the Feeling On ' ) .

Chemistry is the second and final extended play by South Korean duo troublemaker , which consists of 4Minute 's Hyuna and Beast 's Hyunseung . It was released digitally on October 28 , 2013 with the lead single `` Now '' ( ; lit . `` No Tomorrow '' ) .
Promotion and release
On October 4 , 2013 , Cube Entertainment revealed that troublemaker would be making their comeback . A representative said , `` We have established their comeback as troublemaker to be made on the October 24 episode of Mnet 's 'M ! Countdown ' . As it has been a while since they were active as a unit , the both of them are fully engaged in practice and very nervous .
On October 23 , a teaser video and photo was released which showcased a sexy concept ; the release date was clarified to be October 28 , and the lead single would be called `` Now '' ( ) . On October 26 , the official site was launched , showing 12 different teaser photos . The album was released on digital download on October 28 , and on physical album on October 31 . A special limited edition ( 3,000 copies ) , rated 19+ , was released on November 12 . Cube said this version shows a `` level of allure and sexuality exceeding that of troublemaker as everyone knows it now '' .
troublemaker began promoting `` Now '' on October 30 on MBC Music 's Show Champion The song received numerous first place awards in various music show broadcasts , a double crown in Mnet 's M ! Countdown ( November 7 , 14 ) and in KBS Music Bank ( November 8,15 ) , in MBC Music Core ( November 9 ) , in SBS Inkigayo ( November 10 ) and a triple crown in MBC Music Show Champion ( November 6 , 13 , 20 ) .
Music video
The music video for `` Now '' , released on October 24 , was directed by Lee Gi-baek who also directed Beast 's `` Caffeine '' , `` Shadow ( Geurimja ) '' and `` I 'm Sorry '' . The choreography was done by Keone Madrid and Mariel Madrid , who have worked with Urban Dance Camp in Germany .
The music video has a `` Bonnie and Clyde '' theme . Jeff Benjamin of Billboard K-Town wrote that the video `` feels like a concentrated effort to get Western attention '' . He also said , `` 'Now ' shows the two K-pop idols engaging in very un-idol-like behavior : smoking cigarettes , drinking beer , there 's even an implied threesome with Hyunseung . Still , it 's the type of shock tactics that American pop fans have become indifferent to . ''
On November 3 , 2013 , troublemaker released an uncut version of the music video , which was twice as long as the original .

A metallurgical assay is a compositional analysis of an ore , metal , or alloy , usually performed in order to test for purity or quality .
Some assay methods are suitable for raw materials ; others are more appropriate for finished goods . Raw precious metals ( bullion ) are assayed by an assay office . Silver is assayed by titration , gold by cupellation and platinum by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry ( ICP OES ) .
Precious metal items of art or jewelry are frequently hallmarked ( depending upon the requirements of the laws of either the place of manufacture or the place of import ) . Where required to be hallmarked , semi-finished precious metal items of art or jewelry pass through the official testing channels where they are analyzed or assayed for precious metal content . While different nations permit a variety of legally acceptable finenesses , the assayer is actually testing to determine that the fineness of the product conforms with the statement or claim of fineness that the maker has claimed ( usually by stamping a number such as 750 for 18k gold ) on the item . In the past the assay was conducted by using the touchstone method but currently ( most often ) it is done using X-ray fluorescence ( XRF ) . XRF is used because this method is more exacting than the touchstone test . The most exact method of assay is known as fire assay or cupellation . This method is better suited for the assay of bullion and gold stocks rather than works of art or jewelry because it is a completely destructive method .
Touchstone
The touchstone method is most common by far and does not damage the item in question . A rubbing of the item is made on a special stone , treated with acids and the result is compared to the result of the same process done on a sample of gold with a known purity . Red radiolarian chert or black siliceous slate were used for this . Differences in precious metal content as small as 10 to 20 parts per thousand can often be established with confidence by the test , using acids and gold samples both of a specific , known concentration .
X-ray fluorescence
The modern X-ray fluorescence is also a non-destructive technique that is suitable for normal assaying requirements . It typically has an accuracy of 2 to 5 parts per thousand and is well-suited to relatively flat and large surfaces . It is a quick technique taking about three minutes , and the results can be automatically printed out by computer .
One process for X-ray fluorescence assay involves melting the material in a furnace and stirring to make a homogeneous mix . Following this , a sample is taken from the centre of the molten sample . Samples are typically taken using a vacuum pin tube . The sample is then tested by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy . Metallurgical assay is typically completed in this way to ensure that an accurate assay is performed .
Fire assay/cupellation
The most elaborately accurate , but totally destructive , precious metal assay is fire assay . ( It may also be called by the critical cupellation step that separates precious metal from lead . ) If performed on bullion ( high purity precious metal alloy ) to international standards , the method can be accurate on gold metal to 1 part in 10,000 . If performed on ore materials using fusion followed by cupellation separation , detection may be in parts per billion . However , accuracy on ore material is typically limited to 3 to 5 % of reported value . Although time-consuming , the method is the accepted standard applied for valuing gold ore as well as gold and silver bullion at major refineries and gold mining companies .
In the case of fire assaying of gold and platinum ores , the lengthy time required to carry out an assay is generally offset by carrying out large numbers of assays simultaneously , and a typical laboratory will be equipped with some fusion and cupellation furnaces , each capable of taking multiple samples , so that several hundred analyses per day can be carried out . The principal advantage of fire assay is that large samples can be used , and these increase the accuracy in analyzing low-yield ores in the < 1g/T range of concentration .
Fusion : the process requires a self-generating reducing atmosphere , and so the crushed ore sample is mixed with fluxes and a carbon source ( e.g . coal dust , ground charcoal , flour , etc . ) mixed with powdered lead oxide ( litharge ) in a refractory crucible . In general , multiple crucibles will be placed inside an electric furnace fitted with silicon carbide heating elements , and heated to between 1000 and 1200 °C . The temperature required , and the type of flux used , are dependent on the composition of the rock in which the precious metals are concentrated , and in many laboratories an empirical approach based on long experience is used .
A complex reaction takes place , whereby the carbon source reduces the lead oxide to lead , which alloys with the precious metals : at the same time , the fluxes combine with the crushed rock , reducing its melting point and forming a glassy slag . When fusion is complete , the sample is tipped into a mold ( usually iron ) where the slag floats to the top , and the lead , now alloyed with the precious metals , sinks to the bottom , forming a 'button ' . After solidification , the samples are knocked out , and the lead bullets recovered for cupellation , or for analysis by other means .
Method details for various fire assay procedures vary , but concentration and separation chemistry typically comply with traditions set by Bugby or Shepard & Dietrich in the early 20th century . Method advancements since that time primarily automate material handling and final finish measurements ( i.e. , instrument finish rather than physical gold product weighing ) . Arguably , even these texts are largely an extension of traditions that were detailed in De re metallica by Agricola in 1556 .
Variation from skills taught in modern standard adaptions of fire assay methodology should be viewed with caution . The standard traditions have a long history of reliability ; `` special '' new methods frequently associate with reduced assay accuracy and fraud .
Cupellation : the lead bullets are placed in porous crucibles ( cupels ) of bone ash or magnesium oxide and heated in air to about 1000 °C . This is usually carried out in a 'muffle ' furnace , containing a refractory muffle ( usually nitride-bonded silicon carbide ) heated externally by silicon carbide heating elements . A flow of air through the muffle assists oxidation of the lead , and carries the fumes for safe collection outside the furnace unit . The lead melts and oxidises to lead oxide , which in turn melts and is drawn into the pores of the cupel by capillary attraction . The precious metals remain in the base of the cupel as a 'prill ' which is sent for final analysis of precious metal content .
In the bullion fire assay process , a sample from the article is wrapped in a lead foil with copper and silver . The wrapped sample , along with prepared control samples , heated at 1650 F ( temperature varies with exact method ) in a cupel made of compressed bone ash or magnesium oxide powder . Base metals oxidize and absorb into the cupel . The product of this cupellation ( doré ) is flattened and treated in nitric acid to remove silver . Precision weighing of metal content of samples and process controls ( proofs ) at each process stage is the basis of the extreme method precision . European assayers follow bullion traditions based in hallmarking regulations . Reputable North American bullion assayers conform closely to ASTM method E1335-04e1 . Only bullion methods validated and traceable to accepted international standards obtain genuine accuracies of 1 part in 10,000 .
Cupellation alone can only remove a limited quantity of impurities from a sample . Fire assay , as applied to ores , concentrates , or less pure metals , adds a fusion or scorification step before cupellation .
Coins
A coin assayer is often assigned to each mint or assay office to determine and assure that all coins produced at the mint have the correct content or purity of each metal specified , usually by law , to be contained in them . This was particularly important when gold and silver coins were produced for circulation and used in daily commerce . Few nations , however , persist in minting silver or gold coins for general circulation . For example , the U.S. discontinued the use of gold in coinage in 1933 . The U.S. was one of the last nations to discontinue the use of silver in circulating coins after its 1970 half dollar coin , although the amount of silver used in smaller denomination coins was ended after 1964 . Even with the half dollar , the amount of silver used in the coins was reduced from 90 % in 1964 and earlier to 40 % between 1965 and 1970 . Copper , nickel , cupro-nickel and brass alloys now predominate in coin making . Notwithstanding , several national mints , including the Perth Mint in Australia , the Austrian Mint , the British Royal Mint , the Royal Canadian Mint , the South African Mint , and the U.S. Mint continue to produce precious metal bullion coins for collectors and investors . The precious metal purity and content of these coins is guaranteed by the respective mint or government , and , therefore , the assay of the raw materials and finished coins is an important quality control .
In the UK , the Trial of the Pyx is a ceremonial procedure for ensuring that newly minted coins conform to required standards .

Simone Barabino ( c. 1585 – c. 1620 or later ) was an Italian painter of the late-Mannerist style . Born in Val de Polcevera , near Genoa , he was mainly active in his native city , where he trained with Bernardo Castello . He later feuded with his master and left for Milan , where after some works , he stopped painting . Notable works include San Diego restoring sight to blind child for the Nunziata del Guastato in Genoa and Dead Christ with the Virgin and Saints Michael and Andrew for the church of San Girolamo at Milan . He died in penury . Lanzi says he quit his profession and turned to merchandise , in which he did not succeed , and that be died in prison . The exact date of his death is not known , but he may have been quite old when he died .

Uchee Methodist Church is a historic Greek Revival style church in Uchee , Alabama . The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1997 .
History
The Methodist congregation at Uchee dates back to 1833 ; a log church was built in 1836 , the first pastor of which waswas David E. McIntyre . During the second year of his tenure the congregation consisted of 124 white and 53 black members . The structure which now stands was built by L. S. Johnson in c. 1859 in the Greek Revival style , which was popular in Alabama during the antebellum .
The church continued to thrive into the 20th century , and underwent significant alterations in 1980 which , among other things , removed the separated rear section which had originally been used by the segregated black congregants . Declining membership led the congregation to disperse and the church to close in the mid-1980s ; the former congregants , however , continued to maintain the church building for some years afterwards .

Governor Awards
The Governors Awards are an annual ceremony hosted by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences dedicated to honor actors and filmmakers with lifetime achievement awards . Three awards are given : the Academy Honorary Award , the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award , and the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award . Unlike the Academy Awards , the nominations and voting for these awards are restricted to members of the Board of Governors of AMPAS .
The Academy Honorary Award honors exceptional career achievements , contributions to the motion picture industry , and service to the Academy.The Academy Honorary Award is often awarded in preference to those with noted achievements in motion pictures who have nevertheless never won an Academy Award . Thus , many of its recipients are Classic Hollywood stars , such as Lillian Gish , Barbara Stanwyck , Kirk Douglas , and Lauren Bacall .
Among its Honorary Awards for acting , the Academy also presents deserving young actors with the Special Juvenile Academy Award . ( Most of those are not listed here ; some of the early `` Special Awards '' that later became known in that acting category as the `` Special Juvenile Academy Award '' are listed with `` Special Award '' added parenthetically . )
The Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award honors an individual 's outstanding contributions to humanitarian causes .
The Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award honors creative producers , whose bodies of work reflect a consistently high quality of motion picture production .

Indium antimonide ( InSb ) is a crystalline compound made from the elements indium ( In ) and antimony ( Sb ) . It is a narrow-gap semiconductor material from the III-V group used in infrared detectors , including thermal imaging cameras , FLIR systems , infrared homing missile guidance systems , and in infrared astronomy . The indium antimonide detectors are sensitive between 1–5 μm wavelengths .
Indium antimonide was a very common detector in the old , single-detector mechanically scanned thermal imaging systems . Another application is as a terahertz radiation source as it is a strong photo-Dember emitter .
History
The intermetallic compound was first reported by Liu and Peretti in 1951 , who gave its homogeneity range , structure type , and lattice constant . Polycrystalline ingots of InSb were prepared by Heinrich Welker in 1952 , although they were not very pure by today 's semiconductor standards . Welker was interested in systematically studying the semiconducting properties of the III-V compounds . He noted how InSb appeared to have a small direct band gap and a very high electron mobility . InSb crystals have been grown by slow cooling from liquid melt at least since 1954 .
Physical properties
InSb has the appearance of dark-grey silvery metal pieces or powder with vitreous lustre . When subjected to temperatures over 500 °C , it melts and decomposes , liberating antimony and antimony oxide vapors .
The crystal structure is zincblende with a 0.648 nm lattice constant .
Electronic properties
InSb is a narrow direct band gap semiconductor with an energy band gap of 0.17 eV at 300 K and 0.23 eV at 80 K. , under the effect of pressure InSb convert from a direct band gap semiconductor to an indirect band gap semiconductor
Undoped InSb possesses the largest ambient-temperature electron mobility ( 78000 cm2/V⋅s ) , electron drift velocity , and ballistic length ( up to 0.7 μm at 300 K ) of any known semiconductor , except for carbon nanotubes .
Indium antimonide photodiode detectors are photovoltaic , generating electric current when subjected to infrared radiation . InSb 's internal quantum efficiency is effectively 100 % but is a function of the thickness particularly for near bandedge photons . Like all narrow bandgap materials InSb detectors require periodic recalibrations , increasing the complexity of the imaging system . This added complexity is worthwhile where extreme sensitivity is required , e.g . in long-range military thermal imaging systems . InSb detectors also require cooling , as they have to operate at cryogenic temperatures ( typically 80 K ) . Large arrays ( up to 2048×2048 pixels ) are available . HgCdTe and PtSi are materials with similar use .
A layer of indium antimonide sandwiched between layers of aluminium indium antimonide can act as a quantum well . In such a heterostructure InSb/AlInSb has recently been shown to exhibit a robust quantum Hall effect . This approach is studied in order to construct very fast transistors . Bipolar transistors operating at frequencies up to 85 GHz were constructed from indium antimonide in the late 1990s ; field-effect transistors operating at over 200 GHz have been reported more recently ( Intel/QinetiQ ) . Some models suggest that terahertz frequencies are achievable with this material . Indium antimonide semiconductor devices are also capable of operating with voltages under 0.5 V , reducing their power requirements .
Growth methods
InSb can be grown by solidifying a melt from the liquid state ( Czochralski process ) , or epitaxially by liquid phase epitaxy , hot wall epitaxy or molecular beam epitaxy . It can also be grown from organometallic compounds by MOVPE .
Quaternary compounds
Indium antimonide is sometimes alloyed with indium phosphide and Indium arsenide to create a quaternary alloy with a range of band gaps that depend on the different concentration ratios of its components ( InP , InAs and InSb ) , such quaternary alloys was under extensive theoretical studies to study the effect of pressure and temperature on its properties .
Device applications
Thermal image detectors using photodiodes or photoelectromagnetic detectors
Magnetic field sensors using magnetoresistance or the Hall effect
Fast transistors ( in terms of dynamic switching ) . This is due to the high carrier mobility of InSb .

is a Japanese manga written and illustrated by Yuzo Takada . It was serialized in Weekly Manga Action for only three issues in 1991 , with the three published stories later compiled in a single volume collection in December 1997 . The story begins when genius inventor Kyusaku Natsume transplants the brain of a cat found by his son Ryunosuke on Christmas Eve , into a schoolgirl android that he created and subsequently stole from his former employer , Mishima Heavy Industries ( owned by his estranged wife and Ryunosuke 's mother , Akiko Natsume ) . The result , Nuku Nuku ( also known as Atsuko Natsume ) , is a nekomusume or cat girl . The manga was licensed by ADV Manga and published as a single volume on August 24 , 2004 .
Cat Girl Nuku Nuku has been adapted into two OVA series and one anime television series . All three anime adaptations were also licensed in North America by ADV Films . An English language version of the OVA was released by Crusader Video in the United Kingdom on VHS featuring regional accents . Discotek Media has since received the license to the OVA , TV Series and its Dash ! ! spin-off .
Plot
The plot generally focuses on the custody battle for Ryunosuke and the attempts by Akiko and Mishima Heavy Industries to reclaim Nuku Nuku 's body , which often involves amusingly larger-than-life battles between Nuku Nuku and military hardware produced by Mishima Heavy Industries .
Two episodes also deal with a one-sided war between Nuku Nuku and another android named Eimi , who suffers from an over-the-top inferiority complex and envies Nuku Nuku 's more stable design . As it stands , Eimi was made after her and seeks to transfer her programming into Nuku Nuku to ditch her own body , which Akiko calls `` a piece of junk '' . In spite of Eimi being more emotionally unstable than Nuku Nuku , both their fights end in a draw .
Characters
Atsuko 'Nuku Nuku ' Natsume
Voiced by : Megumi Hayashibara ( Japanese ) , Allison Keith ( English )
The de facto protagonist and title character . Nuku Nuku started out as just a stray cat Ryunosuke stumbled upon taking a leak while on the run with his father Kyusaku after retrieving ( stealing ) a prototype android of Kyusaku 's own design to keep it from being sold off to the military by Ryu 's mother Akiko . The stray cat was shot in the crossfire short by Akiko 's henchwomen quickly after Ryu was allowed to keep the cat as a Christmas present . In a moment of brilliance Kyusaku put the dying cat 's brain into the android , giving the feline sapience and the android emotions . Nuku Nuku considers Ryu her brother and Akiko and Kyusaku her parents though she is fully aware of her origins . Nearly indestructible , she acts as Ryu 's , and her own , bodyguard keeping from being reclaimed by the near dementedly overprotective Akiko . Relatively new to the world , Nuku Nuku acts childish at times , and is still easily distracted by stereotypical feline things like mice , but shows a sincere desire to evolve and grow . In spite of her situations , she harbors no ill will towards Akiko or just about anyone , but is more than willing to resort to violence when push comes to shove . To help create the pretense of a normal life she attends high school .
Ryunosuke Natsume
Voiced by : Kazue Ikura ( Japanese ) , Kira Vincent-Davis ( English )
The son of a brilliant if absent minded scientist and the overprotective CEO of a Japan 's number one weapon 's manufacturer , Ryu manages to take it all in stride and enjoys the times where he 's able to squeeze in a normal life and quality time with either of his parents . He loves Nuku Nuku as a sister , but is agitated when his father brushes off her blunders as 'just being a cat ' when at the same time granting her the respect and responsibilities of a human being . Ryu was the one who found the stray cat that would eventually become Nuku Nuku . Ryu is fully aware of how warped his mother can be , but still cares for her all the same ( but still prefers to live with his father over his mother 's smothering affection ) .
Kyusaku Natsume
Voiced by : Akira Kamiya ( Japanese ) , Andrew Klimko ( English )
The brilliant , if quite eccentric , scientist who created a prototype android with funding from his wife 's company . However , with the amount of cash being dumped into the project he realized that his android would be sold off as a weapon . Having no desire to aid his wife 's weapon 's research he fled with his son in tow . He and his wife are not technically divorced and will still chat and bicker like any married couple when the chance arises . He created add-ons for Nuku Nuku on at least one occasion to outfit her for unique situations .
Akiko Natsume
Voiced by : Saeko Shimazu ( Japanese ) , Kelly Manison ( English )
CEO of Japan 's biggest military contractor , and an obsessively protective mother , Akiko 's greatest goals are to reclaim Ryunosuke from her husband and to capture Nuku Nuku in order to reverse engineer her . Because of the delicate nature of the information about Nuku Nuku 's existence she does not try to legally reclaim Ryu , but instead relies on numerous abduction attempts by her two henchwomen Arisa and Kyouko . In spite of her borderline-demented attitude and love of firepower , she does indeed love Ryunosuke and only wants what 's best for him . That said , all else is business to her , and is frighteningly ruthless and manipulative to get what she wants and was even willing to turn a blind eye to Nuku Nuku when the cat girl was working at a restaurant her company owned .
Eimi Yoshikawa
Voiced by : Mika Kanai ( Japanese ) , Cynthia Martinez ( English )
An android built in the image of the deceased granddaughter of Kyusaku Natsume 's mentor , Eimi is emotionally , mentally , and physically unstable . Built in the image of a girl around Ryu 's age , Eimi 's activation resulted in an explosion that killed her grandfather , leaving her legally the property of Akiko 's company . Suffering from multiple sources of psychological trauma on top of ( or maybe because of ) her faulty design , Eimi 's single fixation is taking Nuku Nuku 's body for herself . ( Eimi 's own body doomed to detonate if pushed beyond its limit due a faulty or perhaps non-existent cooling system . ) Eimi openly admits she has no idea how to download her OS into Nuku Nuku 's hardware ( not knowing Nuku Nuku 's brain is biological and not software driven like Eimi 's own ) , but is driven by a lack of a better plan and a superiority-inferiority complex she suffers from Nuku Nuku . Nuku Nuku for her part would love nothing more than to be Eimi 's friend . Eimi admitted to having feelings for Ryu , but brushed off her own emotions as meaningless since like everything else about her is just a software parlor trick , and wrote an apology to Ryu for feeling such 'fake ' emotions towards him . A drama queen and an irrepressible hot-head , Eimi is able to think ahead and be clever but often lets her own impatience get the better of her .
Arisa Sono and Kyouko Ariyoshi
Arisa voiced by : Aya Hisakawa ( Japanese ) , Kaytha Coker ( English )
Kyouko voiced by : Akiko Hiramatsu ( Japanese ) , Tiffany Grant ( English )
Akiko 's two loyal henchwomen , they spearhead the attacks on Nuku Nuku and frequently suffer the consequences . Arisa is the more violent of the two and prefers to use weapons in order to get her way , something which Kyouko tries to restrain .

Class A , also known as Single-A and sometimes as Low-A , is the fourth-highest level of play in Minor League Baseball in the United States , below Triple-A , Double-A , and High-A . There are 30 teams classified at the Single-A level , one for each team in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) , organized into three leagues : the California League , Carolina League , and Florida State League .
History
Class A was originally the highest level of Minor League Baseball , beginning with the earliest classifications , established circa 1890 . Teams within leagues at this level had their players ' contracts protected and the players were subject to reserve clauses . When the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues – the formal name of Minor League Baseball – was founded in 1901 , Class A remained the highest level , restricted to leagues with cities that had an aggregate population of over a million people . Entering the 1902 season , the only Class A leagues were the Eastern League and the Western League—both leagues had eight teams , in cities such as Toronto , Ontario ; Buffalo , New York ; Worcester , Massachusetts ; Omaha , Nebraska ; Denver , Colorado ; and Peoria , Illinois . Leagues operating within less populated areas were classified as Class B , Class C , or Class D .
Class A remained the top classification until Class AA was established in 1912 , then remained the second-highest classification until Class A1 was established in 1936 . In 1946 , the top two levels changed from being Class AA and Class A1 to being Class AAA and AA , with Class A remaining the third-highest level , above Classes B through D. Class A in 1946 consisted of the Eastern League and the original South Atlantic League ( or `` Sally League '' ) , with teams in communities such as Vancouver , British Columbia ; Omaha , Nebraska ; Colorado Springs , Colorado ; Charlotte , North Carolina ; Scranton , Pennsylvania ; and Allentown , Pennsylvania . Class A soon included the Western League ( 1947–1958 ) , Central League ( 1948–1951 ) and Western International League ( 1952–1954 ) . The Western International League became the Class B Northwest League in 1955 , and the Western and Central loops folded .
The hierarchy of Triple-A through Class D continued until Minor League Baseball restructured in 1963 , at which time Classes B through D were abolished , with existing leagues at those levels reassigned into Class A , while the South Atlantic League ( renamed as the Southern League ) and Eastern League ascended to Double-A .
In 1965 , a Class A Short Season designation was created , for teams playing June–September schedules , primarily meant for new players acquired via the amateur draft . The Class A-Advanced designation was established in 1990 , between Class A and Double-A in the minor league hierarchy . Class A and Class A Short Season were considered independent classifications , with Class A having `` Full-Season '' and Advanced sub-classifications , per the rules governing baseball 's minor leagues . The overall hierarchy was :
Triple-A
Double-A
Class A-Advanced
Class A ( `` Full-Season A '' )
Class A Short Season ( `` Short-Season A '' )
Rookie league
Entering the 2020 minor league season ( which was not played , due to the COVID-19 pandemic ) , Class A consisted of the Midwest League and South Atlantic League ( a newer `` Sally League '' , which been formed in 1963 as the Western Carolinas League ) . Prior to the 2021 season , MLB restructured the minor leagues , eliminating Class A Short Season and discontinuing the use of all historical league names within Minor League Baseball . The Midwest League and South Atlantic League were reclassified as `` High-A '' leagues , and operated during 2021 as High-A Central and High-A East , respectively . They were replaced at the Class A level by three `` Low-A '' leagues : Low-A West , Low-A East , and Low-A Southeast . These leagues had historically been known as the California League , Carolina League , and Florida State League , respectively , and had previously operated at the Class A-Advanced level . These three leagues operated with Low-A naming for the 2021 season . Following MLB 's acquisition of the rights to the names of the historical minor leagues , MLB announced on March 16 , 2022 , that the leagues would revert to their prior names , effective with the 2022 season . MLB also discontinued use of `` Low-A '' in favor of Single-A .

The Artificial Kid is a science fiction novel by American writer Bruce Sterling . It was originally published in 1980 .
The Artificial Kid takes place on the planet Reverie , a world of coral continents , levitating islands , and the corrosive , transformative wilderness of `` The Mass . '' Reverie has been transformed into a utopia/dystopia , with a stark class division . Arti , a heavily biologically modified boy from the Decriminalized Zone , becomes a pop star by selling videos of himself engaging in bloody combat with other fighters for the entertainment of the upper classes . When Reverie 's founder , Moses Moses emerges from seven centuries of cryosleep , and Arti discovers an unpleasant secret about his past , both have to flee to escape from the powers of the `` Cabal '' that controls Reverie from behind the scenes .
Reception
Dave Langford reviewed The Artificial Kid for White Dwarf # 69 , and stated that `` Without being exactly convincing , it 's lavishly exuberant in the way SF used to be and literate in the ways it was n't . ''

Four songs were digitally released as promotional singles for the album : `` Titanium '' ( which later became an official single ) on 8 August 2011 , `` Lunar '' ( with Afrojack ) on 15 August 2011 , `` Night of Your Life '' ( featuring Jennifer Hudson ) on 22 August 2011 and `` The Alphabeat '' on 26 March 2012 .

It is noteworthy that all ten main singles from Nothing but the Beat , including the Guetta version `` Sweat '' , have peaked within the top-twenty of the UK Singles Chart and as of January 2015 have all together gone on to sell in excess of four million copies in the country .
Critical reception
At Metacritic , which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , the album received an average score of 56 , based on 17 reviews , which indicates mixed or average reviews . David Jeffries wrote for AllMusic that `` Nothing But the Beat offers the same experience as one of Guetta 's numerous remix sets , but declared that `` something 's missing , something along the lines of 'When Love Takes Over ' . '' In the same vein , Al Fox wrote for BBC Music that `` Whether you could go so far as to call Guetta an auteur might be pushing it , but it 's a cohesive effort , if not quite a work of art . '' Entertainment Weeklys Mikael Wood praised the tracks `` Night of Your Life '' and `` Titanium '' but felt that `` the album feels colder than its sweat factor suggests . '' In an almost neutral review , Jon Dolan wrote for Rolling Stone that the album `` shows how good he is at making Eurohouse 's thumping trounce and jet-engine synth whoosh feel like natural elements in the hip-hop , R & B and even rock continuum . ''
Ally Carnwath wrote a negative review for The Observer , rating it 1 out of 5 stars , writing that the album 's collaborations `` struggle to impose any distinctive personality on the overall mood of relentless rictus-grin-inducing euphoria . '' Tom Ewing from The Guardian criticized Guetta for making `` tiring dancefloor fillers '' and concluded that `` Nothing But the Beat may sound like a one-man hit parade , but it also takes its title far too literally . '' Eric Henderson wrote negatively for Slant Magazine that `` His sound may be the most influential force in pop music today , but he 's paradoxically been artistically overshadowed by imitators and innovators alike , all of whom demonstrate a better understanding of power pop 's legacy ( Lady Gaga 's `` The Edge of Glory '' ) , dance-floor dynamics ( Rihanna 's `` S & M '' ) , and ridiculous self-awareness ( LMFAO 's `` Party Rock Anthem '' ) . '' Robert Christgau gave the album a B+ grade , writing that while he `` only wish [ es ] it had a few ' I Got ta Feeling 's '' , it ultimately `` offends club sophisticates no less than living-room discophobes .

The River Tall is a small river in County Armagh , Northern Ireland which joins the River Blackwater just south of Verner 's Bridge . It is navigable for 4 km by dinghy or canoe .
It rises about 5 km west of Markethill and flows north by Richhill and Ballyhegan , and then turns west .
Originally it flowed into the River Callan at Fairlawn Bridge , but was diverted into a cut excavated in 1851–4 , which intercepts it at a point 2 km above the former confluence and conveys it directly to the Blackwater just above Verner 's Bridge . The `` Old Course of the Tall '' , from the interception down to Fairlawn Bridge , is so named on maps of the time , but it is unnamed on more recent OSNI maps , and may have been partially filled in .
A second cut , completed in 1855 , partly diverted the Callan , by means of a weir at Clonmain Mill near the junction of the Summerisland Road and the Cloveneden Road , to the Tall at a point 0.3 km above the latter 's own diversion , but the bulk of the Callan has continued in its original course . Both cuts are labelled `` Callan River ( New Course ) '' on maps of the time , but are unnamed on more recent OSNI maps .
In common usage , the name `` Tall River '' is now extended to include the first cut , all the way from the interception down to the Blackwater , but OSNI maps attach the name only to the part upstream from the interception . The first cut is also known locally as `` the canal '' .

The Orthodox Roman Catholic Movement ( ORCM ) is a Traditionalist Catholic group of priests founded by Robert McKenna and Francis E. Fenton , acting on the suggestions of Joaquín Sáenz y Arriaga and was the U.S. organization parallel to the Mexican organization Unión Católica Trento , founded by Sáenz along with Moisés Carmona and Adolfo Zamora . Fenton was a founding member of the conservative John Birch Society , and was on its American Opinion Speakers Bureau . The Orthodox Roman Catholic Movement established twenty-seven chapels in North America in which the Tridentine Mass is offered .
Origins
By fall 1975 , the ORCM had gained Paul Marceau , Charles P. Donohue , Leo M. Carley and Daniel E. Jones ( `` Dan Jones '' ) , the English Benedictine Placid White , Joseph Gorecki and some other priests , totaling eleven , and services were being held in California , Colorado , Florida , New Jersey and New York . A growth period followed , and by 1979 a circuit system set up among the eleven priests offered the Tridentine Mass in sixteen states .
Current situation
Among present or former ORCM members , besides McKenna ( in 1986 ) , it seems that Paul Marceau too had been consecrated a bishop , for he is credited with having performed the consecration of the Church of Our Lady of Fatima at Spring Hills , Florida .
McKenna died on December 16 , 2015 . The future of the movement is uncertain , with at least some parishes having been given to the Society of Saint Pius X .

Niuas is an electoral constituency which sends one representative to the Legislative Assembly of Tonga . It covers the islands of Niuafoʻou and Niuatoputapu .
Since its inception in 1875 , the Assembly has consisted in representatives of the people and in members of the nobility . Following constitutional reforms in 2010 , designed to strengthen democracy in the kingdom , the nobility elect nine representatives , while the people elect seventeen . The nobles ' constituency in the Niuas thus overlaps with a peoples ' constituency , which also elects a single representative .
Members of the nobility whose title is attached to lands in the constituency may vote there , and be elected as the constituency 's representative . Nobles do not formally stand as candidates , however , and never belong to any political party . Following the 2010 electoral reforms , any person holding more than one title , corresponding to lands in several constituencies , may only vote in one constituency . The titles corresponding to the Niuas are Fotofili , Fusituʻa , Maʻatu and Tangipa , meaning that the constituency may have up to four voters . At present , the holder of the title of Fotofili also holds the title of Kalaniuvalu , which entitles him to vote in the Tongatapu constituency . The Maʻatu title is vacant . Thus , the constituency actually consists in between two and three voters .
History , recent elections and members
The constituency as such did not exist for the first Assembly in 1875 . At that time , there were twenty nobles in all the kingdom , and they all sat in the Assembly , along with twenty elected peoples ' representatives ; the islands of Niuafoʻou and Niuatoputapu were each associated with a title , and therefore each had a noble representing them . As the number of titles of nobility was increased by successive monarchs , a constitutional amendment in 1914 provided that the nobles would henceforth elect seven among them to represent them ; the number of peoples ' representatives was also decreased to seven . The nobles ' constituency of Niuas , as such , may have been established at this time .
Records of elections are sparse . In the 1996 general election , the Honourable Fusituʻa was elected ; there is no further information . Nor is there any information for the 1999 , 2002 or 2005 general election results . In the 2008 election , three votes were cast in the Niuas : two for Lord Tangipa , and one for Lord Fotofili ; the former was thus duly elected . In the 2010 election , specific voting figures were not reported , but Lord Fusituʻa was elected with a single vote , which suggests that only one vote was cast . This may be explained by Lord Fotofili opting to vote in Tongatapu , and Lord Fusituʻa himself not casting a vote ( or voting blank ) , so that Lord Tangipa 's lone vote could elect him .
Lord Fusituʻa died on 24 April 2014 , leading to a by-election on 21 May . His son , the new Lord Fusituʻa , was elected unanimously with two votes to take his seat . In August 2020 the seat was declared vacant due to Fusituʻa 's failing to attend Parliament for over a year . A by-election will be held to fill the vacant seat .

SMS Friedrich Carl was an ironclad warship built for the Prussian Navy in the mid-1860s . The ship was constructed in the French Societé Nouvelles des Forges et Chantiers shipyard in Toulon ; her hull was laid in 1866 and launched in January 1867 . The ship was commissioned into the Prussian Navy in October 1867 . The ship was the third ironclad ordered by the Prussian Navy , after and , though the fourth ship to be acquired , , was ordered after but commissioned before Friedrich Carl .
Friedrich Carl served with the fleet from her commissioning in 1867 until 1895 , when she was removed from front-line service to serve as a training ship . During the Franco-Prussian War in 1870–1871 , the ship formed part of the main German squadron commanded by Vizeadmiral ( Vice Admiral ) Eduard von Jachmann . Engine trouble , however , plagued the ship and two of the other three vessels in the squadron ; as a result , they made only two sorties from the port of Wilhelmshaven to challenge the French blockade . Neither resulted in combat .
Friedrich Carl was also deployed to Spain during an insurrection in 1873 , during which she assisted in the seizure of three rebel vessels in two engagements . The ship was refitted at the Imperial Dockyard in Wilhelmshaven in the 1880s . She was renamed Neptun in 1902 and used as a harbor ship until June 1905 , when she was removed from the naval register . The following year , she was sold to ship breakers in the Netherlands and dismantled for scrap .
Design
Following the acquisition of the small ironclad warships and , which were only usable in coastal areas , the Prussian Navy sought to acquire armored vessels capable of operations on the high seas . The purpose of the new ships would be primarily directed against Prussia 's primary naval rival , Denmark , which in the recent Second Schleswig War had imposed a blockade of German ports that Prussia had not been able to break . Ironclads were at that time a recent development and the only option for sea-going warships was the armored frigate , modeled on traditional sailing ships with a battery on the broadside . The navy requested approval from the ( Parliament ) in 1865 for an expanded budget to acquire the needed vessels , but the parliament refused , prompting King Wilhelm I to circumvent the legislature with a decree on 4 July authorizing the purchase of two armored frigates .
At that time , Britain and France had the shipbuilders most experienced with the type , so the navy decided to order one vessel from each country . The contract for Friedrich Carl was placed on 9 January 1866 followed by that for four days later , from France and Britain respectively . The French-built Friedrich Carl was modeled on , albeit a smaller version of the French ironclad .
General characteristics
Friedrich Carl was long at the waterline and long overall . She had a beam of and a draft of forward and aft . The ship was designed to displace at a normal loading , and up to with a full load . The ship 's hull was constructed with transverse and longitudinal iron frames . It contained eight watertight compartments and had a double bottom that ran for 76 percent of the length of the vessel .
Friedrich Carl was an excellent sea boat ; the ship was responsive to commands from the helm and had a moderate turning radius . Steering was controlled with a single rudder . She was somewhat unbalanced , however , and a 6 degree rudder to port was required to keep the ship on a straight course . The ship 's crew numbered 33 officers and 498 enlisted men , and while serving as a flagship , the crew was augmented with a command staff of 6 officers and 35 enlisted men . Friedrich Carl carried a number of smaller boats , including a large tender , two launches , a pinnace , two cutters , two yawls , and one dinghy .
A horizontal , two-cylinder single-expansion steam engine powered the ship . It drove a four-bladed screw propeller in diameter . Six trunk boilers , divided into two boiler rooms with eleven fireboxes in each , supplied steam to the engine at . Both boiler rooms were vented into a single funnel . The propulsion system was rated at and a top speed of , though on trials Friedrich Carl managed to make and . The ship carried of coal , which enabled a maximum range of at a cruising speed of . A barque rig with a surface area of 2,010 square meters supplemented the steam engine , though in service they added little to the ship 's performance .
Armament and armor
As built , Friedrich Carl was equipped with a main battery of twenty-six rifled 72-pounder cannon . After her delivery to Germany , these guns were replaced with a pair of L/22 guns and fourteen 21 cm L/19 guns . The L/22 gun could depress to −5 degrees and elevate to 13 degrees , which provided a range of . The shorter barreled L/19 guns had a wider range of elevation , from −8 to 14.5 degrees , but the shorter barrel imposed a lower muzzle velocity , which correspondingly reduced the range of the gun to . The two types of gun fired the same shell , of which the total supply numbered 1,656 rounds of ammunition . The fourteen L/19 guns were placed in a central battery amidships , seven on either broadside . The L/22 guns were placed on either end of the ship to serve as chase guns .
Later in her career , six Hotchkiss revolver cannon were added to provide a defense against torpedo boats . Five torpedo tubes were also installed at that time . Two of the tubes were placed in the bow , two on the ship 's sides , and one in the stern on the port side . All were placed above the waterline , and were supplied with a total of twelve torpedoes .
Friedrich Carls armor consisted of wrought iron backed with heavy teak planking . The waterline armored belt consisted of of iron backed with of teak . Above the belt was a strake of iron plate of the same thickness of the belt , on of teak , which covered the central battery . The battery 's roof was protected by iron plating , intended to deflect shots that passed over the side of the ship or fragments from explosions . The ship 's conning tower had 114 mm thick iron armor mounted on of teak .
Service history
The Prussian Navy ordered Friedrich Carl from a French shipbuilder in 1865 . She was laid down at the Societé Nouvelles des Forges et Chantiers La Seyne shipyard in Toulon the following year . The ship was launched on 16 January 1867 ; fitting out work was completed rapidly , and the ship was completed before the end of the year . Friedrich Carl was delivered to Prussia in October 1867 and commissioned into the fleet on the 3rd of the month . Crews for Friedrich Carl and Kronprinz were carried to the ships by the screw frigate and the screw corvette . Both ironclads were laid up without any armament on entering service , as the new guns that had been intended to have been installed suffered serious failures during testing in 1867–1868 ; the Kreiner breech blocks proved to be prone to failure and so Krupp-designed guns were installed instead , with the work completed by July 1869. in June 1870 , Friedrich Carl collided with the Danish schooner Auguste Robert in the Dogger Bank . The schooner was abandoned ; Dutch fishermen rescued her crew .
Franco-Prussian War
At the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 , the greatly numerically inferior Prussian Navy assumed a defensive posture against a naval blockade imposed by the French Navy . Friedrich Carl and the broadside ironclads Kronprinz and , along with the small ironclad ram Prinz Adalbert , had been steaming in the English Channel before the French declared war ; they had left Plymouth on 10 July with the intention of steaming to Fayal in the Azores . On the 13th , however , they put into port and learned of the rising tension between France and Prussia . The ships therefore returned to Wilhelmshaven immediately , arriving on 16 July . France declared war on Prussia three days later on 19 July . Friedrich Carl , Kronprinz , and König Wilhelm were concentrated in the North Sea at the port of Wilhelmshaven . They were subsequently joined there by the turret ship Arminius , which had been stationed in Kiel .
Despite the great French naval superiority , the French had conducted insufficient pre-war planning for an assault on the Prussian naval installations , and concluded that it would only be possible with Danish assistance , which was not forthcoming . The four ships , under the command of Vizeadmiral ( Vice Admiral ) Eduard von Jachmann , made an offensive sortie in early August 1870 out to the Dogger Bank , though they encountered no French warships . Friedrich Carl and the other two broadside ironclads thereafter suffered from chronic engine trouble , which left Arminius alone to conduct operations . Friedrich Carl , Kronprinz , and König Wilhelm stood off the island of Wangerooge for the majority of the conflict , while Arminius was stationed in the mouth of the Elbe river . On 11 September , the three broadside ironclads were again ready for action ; they joined Arminius for another major operation into the North Sea . It too did not encounter French opposition , as the French Navy had by this time returned to France .
Through the 1870s , the German armored fleet typically saw active service during the summer months . Over the winter , most of the vessels were placed in reserve with one or two kept in a state of reduced commission as guard ships . In June 1871 , the screw corvette was in Brazil while on an overseas cruise ; some of her crew had been arrested following a fistfight in the country . The Germans threatened to deploy Kronprinz , three more corvettes , and two gunboats , which convinced the Brazilian government to release the crewmen . Beginning in September 1872 , Friedrich Carl embarked on a world cruise with the screw frigate and the gunboat . They were joined by Elisabeths sister ships and while cruising through the Caribbean Sea .
Deployment to Spain
In early 1873 , the First Spanish Republic was beset with the Cantonal Revolution . Friedrich Carl , under the command of Vizeadmiral Reinhold Werner , steamed to Spanish waters along with a pair of unarmored vessels . The ships joined a British squadron that had been patrolling the southern Spanish coast . A rebel faction of the Spanish Navy had seized four of the country 's seven ironclads . Werner , the senior commander in the group , was given command of the Anglo-German force . The squadron blockaded two rebel ironclads in the port of Cartagena after they had bombarded a coastal town . While steaming off Alicante , Friedrich Carl encountered the rebel armed steamer Vigilante , seized the vessel , and returned it to the national government .
Friedrich Carl and the British ironclad attacked two of the rebel ships—Vitoria and Almansa—without authorization from London or Berlin . The rebel vessels had attempted to extort the port of Almería . In the brief engagement , the Anglo-German force overwhelmed the rebels and seized both ships , which were subsequently turned over to the Spanish government . The rebels considered declaring war on Germany over the affair , but eventually decided against it . A captured rebel leader was briefly held on board Friedrich Carl . Werner 's blockade eventually forced the rebels to surrender , after which Friedrich Carl returned to Germany . Chancellor Otto von Bismarck ordered a court-martial for Werner , whose actions Bismarck considered to be excessive . Bismarck prohibited the Imperial Navy from conducting `` gunboat diplomacy '' in the future .
Later service
In 1876 , the ironclad squadron—Kronprinz , Friedrich Carl , and the new ironclads and —were sent to the Mediterranean Sea in response to the murder of the German consul in Salonika in the Ottoman Empire . The German ships were joined by French , Russian , Italian , and Austro-Hungarian warships in an international demonstration condemning the murder . The Germans returned home in August and , after arriving in September , were laid up for the winter . The squadron went to the Mediterranean again in 1877 , though this time it included Friedrich Carl , Kaiser , Deutschland , and the turret ship , along with the aviso . During the cruise , the ships visited various ports in the Aegean Sea and along the Levant . Friedrich Carl remained laid up for the 1878 training cruise that saw the loss of the brand-new ironclad in an accidental collision with Kaiser . She returned to service in May 1879 , serving as the flagship of the training squadron , which also included Kronprinz , Preussen , and . The ship remained in service through 1883 ; later that year , the training cycle concluded with a large-scale simulated attack on Kiel , with Friedrich Carl and the other ironclads acting as an `` eastern '' opponent . The defenders , led by the corvettes and , were judged to have been victorious . The armored fleet operated entirely under steam power that year , the first time it did so .
In 1885 , Friedrich Carl had torpedo nets installed ; these remained on the ship until 1897 . During the 1885 refit , she also received new boilers and a modified funnel that had a second uptake installed . The battery of six 37 mm Hotchkiss guns and five torpedo tubes were also fitted during this modernization . The ship took part in the 1885 maneuvers with the armored corvettes and . In 1887 , she was present for the ceremonies marking the beginning of construction of the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal , which was to link the Kiel with the North Sea . In 1895 , the ship was disarmed ; she was placed into service as a torpedo test ship on 11 August of that year . She served in this capacity until 21 January 1902 , when she was renamed Neptun and used as a harbor ship . Her name was then freed to be reused on the new armored cruiser , which was launched on 22 June 1902 . Neptun was formally stricken from the naval register on 22 June 1905 and sold to a Dutch ship-breaking firm in March 1906 for 284,000 gold marks . The ship was then towed to the Netherlands and broken up for scrap .

Darren Dreger ( born June 13 , 1968 ) is a Canadian sportscaster for TSN , and currently serves as one of TSN 's Hockey Insiders . He had previously hosted Leafs Lunch on CFMJ AM640 Toronto Radio .
Broadcasting career
After graduating from the Western Academy Broadcasting College , Dreger was immediately offered a job from a radio station in Winkler , Manitoba . However , in the same day , he was offered another job closer to home , which he accepted . Beginning in 1992 , Dreger lent his voice as a play-by-play announcer for the Brandon Wheat Kings . This lasted until 1993 when he was hired to replace Daren Millard at CTV Winnipeg . While there , he also conducted play-by-play for the Manitoba Moose of the American Hockey League .
From Winnipeg , Dreger moved to Edmonton in 1997 to report on Edmonton Oilers games and was subsequently hired by Sportsnet as a national host for their NHL package in 1998 . Dreger was the former host of Hockey Central '' on Rogers Sportsnet between 1998 and 2006 . On July 14 , 2006 , it was announced that Dreger would leave Sportsnet and join TSN on July 31 , 2006 , hence 'crossing the parking lot ' .
Dreger won a Gemini Award in 2010 in the Best Sports Reporting category for his coverage of the firing of NHLPA Executive Director Paul Kelly . He was the only reporter in Chicago when the news broke and therefore had sole coverage . In October 2014 , Bob McKenzie and Dreger began appearing as a full-time contributor on NBCSN , until NBC Sports lost the NHL hockey rights to both ESPN and Turner Sports in 2021 . This was due to the fact that TSN lost their NHL broadcasting rights package to Sportsnet .

Anthony Hsieh ( ; December 12 , 1973November 27 , 2020 ) was an American internet entrepreneur and venture capitalist . He retired as the CEO of the online shoe and clothing company Zappos in August 2020 after 21 years . Prior to joining Zappos , Hsieh co-founded the Internet advertising network LinkExchange , which he sold to Microsoft in 1998 for $ 265 million .
Early life and education
Hsieh was born in Urbana , Illinois , to Richard and Judy Hsieh , immigrants from Taiwan who met in graduate school at the University of Illinois . Hsieh 's family moved to Lucas Valley area of Marin County , California when he was five . His mother was a social worker , and his father a chemical engineer at Chevron Corp . He had two younger brothers , Andy and Dave . Hsieh attended the Branson School .
In 1995 , Hsieh graduated from Harvard University with a degree in computer science . While at Harvard , he managed the Quincy House Grille selling pizza to the students in his dorm ; his best customer , Alfred Lin , would later become Zappos 's chief financial officer and chief operating officer . After college , Hsieh worked for Oracle Corporation . After five months , he left to co-found the LinkExchange advertising network .
Career
LinkExchange
In 1996 , Hsieh started developing the idea for an advertising network called LinkExchange with his college classmates Sanjay Mandan and Ali Partovi . Members were allowed to advertise their site over LinkExchange 's network by displaying banner ads on its website . They launched in March 1996 , with Hsieh as CEO , and found their first 30 clients by direct emailing webmasters . The site grew , and within 90 days LinkExchange had over 20,000 participating web pages and had its banner ads displayed over 10 million times . By 1998 , the site had over 400,000 members and 5 million ads rotated daily . In November 1998 , LinkExchange was sold to Microsoft for $ 265 million .
Venture Frogs
After LinkExchange sold to Microsoft , Hsieh co-founded and owned Venture Frogs , an incubator and investment firm , with his business partner , Alfred Lin . The name originated from a dare . One of Hsieh 's friends said she would invest everything if they chose `` Venture Frogs '' as the name , and the pair took her up on the bet , although they had not seen any money as of 2011 . They invested in a variety of tech and Internet startups , including Ask Jeeves , OpenTable and Zappos .
Zappos
In 1999 , Nick Swinmurn approached Tony Hsieh and Alfred Lin with the idea of selling shoes online . Hsieh was initially skeptical and almost deleted Swinmurn 's initial voice mail . After Swinmurn mentioned that `` footwear in the US is a $ 40 billion market , and 5 % of that was already being sold by paper mail order catalogs , '' Hsieh and Lin decided to invest through Venture Frogs . Two months later , Hsieh joined Zappos as the CEO , starting with $ 1.6 million of total sales in 2000 . By 2009 , revenues reached $ 1 billion .
Without a precedent to guide him , Hsieh learned how to make customers feel comfortable shopping for shoes online . Zappos offered free shipping and free returns , sometimes of several pairs . Hsieh rethought Zappos structure , and in 2013 it became for a time a holacracy without job titles , reflecting his belief in employees and their ability to self-organize . The company hired only about 1 % of all applicants . Named for the Spanish word for shoes , `` zapatos '' , Zappos was often listed in Fortune as one of the best companies to work for , and beyond high salaries and being an inviting place to work it delivered extraordinary customer service .
Hsieh loved the game of poker and moved Zappos headquarters to Henderson , Nevada , and eventually to downtown Las Vegas .
On July 22 , 2009 , Amazon announced the acquisition of Zappos.com in a deal valued at approximately $ 1.2 billion . Hsieh is said to have made at least $ 214 million from the sale , not including money made through his former investment firm Venture Frogs .
On August 24 , 2020 , Hsieh retired as the CEO of Zappos after 21 years at the helm .
JetSuite
Hsieh joined JetSuite 's board in 2011 . He led a $ 7 million round of investment in the growing private `` very light jet '' field with that company . The investment allowed JetSuite to add two new Embraer Phenom 100 jets which have two pilots , two engines and safety features equivalent to large commercial passenger jets but weigh less than and are consequently highly fuel-efficient .
Real estate rejuvenation projects
Downtown Project – Las Vegas
From 2009 until his death , Hsieh , who was still running the downtown Las Vegas-based Zappos.com business , organized a major re-development and revitalization project for downtown Las Vegas , which had been for the most part left behind compared to the Las Vegas Strip 's growth . Hsieh originally planned the Downtown Project as a place where Zappos.com employees could live and work , but the project grew beyond that to a vision where thousands of local tech and other entrepreneurs could live and work . Projects funded include The Writer 's Block , the first independent bookseller in Las Vegas .
Park City , Utah
After stepping down as CEO of Zappos in August 2020 , Hsieh bought multiple properties in Park City , Utah , with a total market value around $ 56 million .
Awards
Hsieh was a member of the Harvard University team that won the 1993 ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest in Indianapolis , ranking first of 31 entrants .
Hsieh received an Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year award for the Northern California region in 2007 .
Delivering Happiness
Hsieh 's 2010 book Delivering Happiness focused on his entrepreneurial endeavors . It was profiled in many world publications , including The Washington Post , CNBC , TechCrunch , The Huffington Post and The Wall Street Journal . It debuted at No . 1 on the New York Times Best Seller List and stayed on the list for 27 consecutive weeks .
Personal life
Hsieh resided primarily in Downtown Las Vegas , and also owned a residence in Southern Highlands , Nevada . Hsieh was known for taking extreme challenges regarding his body , including starving himself of oxygen to induce hypoxia , using nitrous oxide , and fasting to the point where he was under . Singer Jewel said that she was aware of Hsieh 's extreme drug abuse and sent him a letter months before his death to warn him .
Death
On the morning of November 18 , 2020 , Hsieh was injured in a house fire in New London , Connecticut , although his identity was not revealed at the time . It has been reported that he was visiting family for Thanksgiving , and he either became trapped in a pool shed during the fire , or barricaded himself inside and would not answer the door . The exact cause of the fire is under investigation . He was rescued by firefighters and transported to the Connecticut Burn Center at Bridgeport Hospital to undergo treatment for burns and smoke inhalation , where he died on November 27 , two weeks before his 47th birthday . The Connecticut medical examiner determined that Hsieh died from smoke inhalation , and ruled his death was an accident . News sources have suggested that his drug use and nitrous oxide use may have played a role in his death .
The Wall Street Journal reported that according to property records , Hsieh was staying at a house that was possibly owned by a former Zappos employee , Rachael Brown .

The Jackson County Courthouse , located at Main Street and Broadway in Altus , is the county courthouse serving Jackson County , Oklahoma . Construction began on the courthouse in 1910 , two years after Altus became the permanent county seat of Jackson County , and was completed in 1911 . Architecture firm C.E . Hair and Company designed the building in the Classical Revival style ; it was the first county courthouse the firm planned in Oklahoma . The three-story courthouse is built from limestone with a granite foundation . A two-story portico supported by four columns surrounds the main entrance . While a metal dome originally topped the building , it was removed in 1938 due to irreparable corrosion .
The courthouse is part of a public square that also contains the county jail and several other structures . The jail was constructed in 1924–25 to replace a jail in the courthouse basement . Due to a series of additions and renovations in the 1960s , it no longer retains its historic appearance . The courthouse grounds also include a United Daughters of the Confederacy memorial , a well , and a statue of a cowboy .
The courthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 . In 2008 , its listing boundaries expanded to include the courthouse square ; however , only the Confederate memorial is considered a contributing structure to the listing .

Francis Asbury , also known as the Francis Asbury Memorial , is a public equestrian statue , by American artist Augustus Lukeman , located at 16th Street and Mt . Pleasant Street , Northwest , Washington , D.C. , in the Mount Pleasant neighborhood .
It was originally surveyed as part of the Smithsonian 's Save Outdoor Sculpture ! survey in 1994 .

Francis Asbury Statue Washington D.C. Dedication Events
During the leap year of 1919 , President Woodrow Wilson and the 66th Congress of the United States gave approval to the site and location for the Francis Asbury Statue . This formal event which occurred on February 29 , 1919 allowed for the newly formed Francis Asbury Memorial Foundation to begin its work to raise monies for the Francis Asbury Statue .
For design of the statue , The Francis Asbury Memorial Foundation chose Mr. Evarts Tracy .
The distinguished designer from the New York architectural firm , Tracy and Swartwout , was not only a talented architect and designer , he was the great-great grandson of Roger Sherman , a signer of the American Declaration of Independence . In addition to his design architectural design experience , Mr. Evarts Tracy was commissioned years earlier to design camouflage techniques for the troops on the front line of World War I .
The design of the Francis Asbury Statue by Mr. Evarts Tracy began in the year 1919 . Upon completion of the design , the Francis Asbury Memorial Foundation chose the Roman Bronze Works of New York to build the equestrian memorial . In 1921 , the Roman Bronze Works in turn commissioned the independent artist , Henry Augustus Lukeman to sculpt the Asbury Statue .
The American sculptor was born in Richmond , Virginia in 1872 : at the early age of ten he began to sculpt with wood and clay . Through a workshop at the New York-based Boys ' Club he learned the basics of sculpting . For the next three years , his fascination with the art form led him to study under the Irish artist and immigrant , Launt Thompson . By the age of sixteen , Augustus Lukeman gained an apprenticeship at the New York City based foundry founded by Mr. John Williams . He remained in this learning program until 1891 when he reached the age of nineteen . For the next few years , Augustus Lukeman spent his days studying and working with terra cotta and his evenings studying drawing techniques and antiques at the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art .
By the summer of 1924 , Augustus Lukeman was nearly complete with the Francis Asbury Statue .
Wednesday , October 15 , 1924 at 2:30 pm , several thousand people gather to view the dedication ceremony for the Francis Asbury Statue . Dignitaries from Washington D.C. seat on the white-draped platform . The photos from the day were taken from an advantageous viewpoint . The article , Francis Asbury Statue Dedication , displays the photos from the actual event .
In one of the photos , President Calvin Coolidge stands at the podium , ready to give his speech which contains the famous phrase about Francis Asbury which many who know of Asbury are familiar with , “ He is entitled to rank as one of the builders of our nation . ”
Another photo from the day of the dedication displays the patriotic manner in which the statue was vailed before the ceremony . Two large American flags flank either side of the statue . “ The shot taken from the crowd level is a stunning depiction of Francis Asbury and the flags of his adopted country . A country in which he spent nearly his entire life leading the people of the frontier to Jesus Christ . ”
Information
The sculpture was founded by Roman Bronze Works in New York City . The piece was erected by the Francis Asbury Memorial Foundation and was approved by Congress on February 29 , 1919 . It was dedicated on October 15 , 1924 and cost $ 50,000 .

The North Carolina News Network ( sometimes called NCNN ) is a news and information service established in 1942 . It provides programming to approximately 75 radio stations , primarily in the state of North Carolina , and can also be heard by Internet streaming via its website .
History
The roots of this network go back to 1942 , when WRAL ( 1240 AM ; now WPJL ) in Raleigh , North Carolina began producing agricultural reports for farmers in the Eastern part of the state . Shortly after returning from service in World War II , Ray Wilkinson began delivering agricultural reports in Rocky Mount , North Carolina on radio station WCEC 810 AM ( now dark ) , where he was Program Director . Shortly thereafter , WRAL expressed interest in broadcasting Wilkinson 's reports , and the groundwork was laid for the foundation of the Tobacco Radio Network , the predecessor to NCNN .
The network was so-named because tobacco was the leading agricultural crop in Eastern North Carolina , where the oldest stations of the network were based . With the establishment of WRAL-FM in 1946 , the network took advantage of its static-free reception and wide coverage area to begin relaying programming to other stations that desired agricultural news . Eventually , the network was available to nearly all of North Carolina through a system of FM repeater stations .
Feeder stations for the network included :
WRAL-FM/101.5 , Raleigh — Main origination station
WCEC-FM/100.7 , Rocky Mount ( now WRDU ) — Eastern Zone feeder station
WGBR-FM/97.7 , Goldsboro ( now WZKT ) — Southeastern Zone feeder station
WGWR-FM/92.3 , Asheboro ( now WKRR ) — Central Zone feeder station
WEGO-FM/97.9 , Concord ( now WPEG ) — Western Zone feeder station
A companion network , the Tobacco Sports Network , was formed in the mid 1950s to broadcast College Football and College Basketball for the four major universities centered in and around Raleigh . Broadcast commentators for events on this network included Bill Currie and Ray Reeve . It was this network that broadcast the North Carolina Tar Heels ' winning game in the 1957 NCAA basketball championship to a statewide audience .
In 1963 , Wilkinson became Farm News Director for WRAL , and the programming he was producing for the network went to Raleigh with him . He became Vice-President of Capitol Broadcasting Company , in charge of both networks , a position he held for 31 years .
With Wilkinson 's move to WRAL , operations for the two networks were consolidated by Capitol Broadcasting and renamed the T-N Radio Network . A news staff was hired , and hourly newscasts were begun . During the 1960s , the distinctive three-note news sounder could regularly be heard at 55 minutes past the hour on radio stations across North Carolina .
In 1973 , concurrent with programming changes at parent station WRAL-FM , the network was re-imaged to the current `` North Carolina News Network '' for news , weather and sports reports , while agricultural reports continued as `` T-N Farm News . ''
By 1978 , the network had discontinued the FM feeder station distribution , and was carried by telephone lines as a conventional network . That change would only be temporary , as Capitol Broadcasting began satellite distribution of NCNN in 1983 .
The satellite bandwidth provided to NCNN by Capitol Satellite Services allowed the network to re-enter Sports Broadcasting in a big way in the 1990s , offering distribution services for North Carolina State University and Duke University games , and those of the NBA Charlotte Hornets .
In recent years , NCNN has become available to listeners worldwide by streaming audio on the internet .
On August 10 , 2009 NCNN owners Capitol Broadcasting Company announced the sale of the network to Curtis Media Group , also of Raleigh . Curtis owns stations in the Raleigh Market , as well as station groups in Wilmington , Goldsboro , Burlington , Winston-Salem and Boone .
Programming
As T-N , the network developed some programming distinctive to North Carolina interests . Being based in Raleigh , the state capital , much of the network 's programming dealt with legislative and other governmental activities . A group of stringer reporters informed T-N Network listeners of news from other areas of the state . Statewide and regional weather reports were a fixture on the T-N Network , and daily sports reports dealt almost exclusively with North Carolina high school and college teams .
Daily editorials by WRAL-TV commentator Jesse Helms were broadcast on the T-N Network , and are generally credited as a major contributing factor to his winning election to the U.S. Senate in 1972 .
Since becoming NCNN , the network has expanded coverage of high school sports in North Carolina , becoming the major source for scores from football games across the state on Saturday mornings each fall . Coverage of the North Carolina Legislature has become more in-depth , with programs devoted to legislative coverage each year when the Legislature is in session .
NCNN is known for giving extensive , regionalized forecasts for the entire state of North Carolina , prepared by a team of in-house meteorologists ( which they share with WRAL-TV and WRAL-FM ) .
Some of the current offerings of the North Carolina News Network include :
Hourly Newscasts
Five minutes of North Carolina news at :55 past each hour
Sportscasts
News of sporting events with a North Carolina angle air at :25 past the hour in mornings and afternoons .

The Dr. Kuno Struck House , also known as Clifton Manor , is a historic building located in the West End of Davenport , Iowa , United States . It was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 , and on the Davenport Register of Historic Properties in 1996 . The house , along with its garage , became a part of the Marycrest College campus and they were both listed as contributing properties in the Marycrest College Historic District in 2004 .
Dr. Kuno Struck
Kuno Struck was born in Davenport in 1883 to Henry C. and Johanna ( Wessel ) Struck . He graduated from the local schools and received a medical degree from the State University of Iowa . He specialized in bacteriology and pathology . He started a practice in Davenport after a year with his cousin in Moline , Illinois , Dr. Arp . Dr . Struck married Norma Petersen , the daughter of Max D. Petersen who was one of the owners of the J.H.C . Petersen 's Sons ' Store . However , Struck stopped practicing medicine shortly after his marriage to Norma . While he spent most of his time traveling , he also served as a vice president at Davenport Bank and Trust and on the boards of a variety of local organizations . Struck had interests in painting , playing the violin , ornithology , and wild flowers .
History
The house was designed by the Davenport architectural firm of Clausen & Kruse in the Jacobean Revival style . It is the only house built in this architectural style in the city . The house was completed in 1911 and called Clifton Manor . Norma 's family home Clifton Hill was on the property next door . Dr . Struck lived here until his death in 1947 . Norma , and their only child Dorothy and her husband , continued to live in the house . Dorothy was married at least twice , to William Mundy and James H. Bell . A gardener and chauffeur were also a part of the household . Lavish parties were held in the house in the 1950s and the 1960s . Norma died in 1973 .
The family sold the house before it became a part of Marycrest College in 1978 and served the college as a community center . It also housed a variety of offices for the school in subsequent years . In 1984 area designers transformed the house for a Decorators ' Show House fundraiser for the Quad City Symphony Orchestra . After the college closed the rest of the campus was converted into Marycrest Senior Living , but the Struck House has remained separate from that development . It was sold to Marlene and Donald Talbot in 2005 and to Randy and Mary McDonald in 2018 .
Architecture
The house is 2½-stories and follows a rectangular plan . The main façades are on the long sides of the structure , and it is capped with a hipped roof . The north façade is asymmetrical while the south façade follows a symmetrical plan with gabled end pavilions that flank a semi-circular terrace . The exterior is covered in a pink-red brick and a rock-faced stone that is smoothly dressed . The interior features a grand central staircase in the foyer , a large living room with a stone fireplace , a dining room with a honeycombed ceiling , and a solarium with curved walls and arched , colored glass windows . The walls are covered with patterned cloth wallpaper . Leaded glass windows with some colored glass are located throughout the house . Kuno Struck considered it pretentious to display one of his paintings in his home , but the owners who began a restoration project in 2019 displayed a reproduction of one of his paintings in the living room .
The house is situated on a large lot with a circular drive that connects it to West Twelfth Street . The single-story garage sits to the northeast of the house . It is composed of brick and features both double and single car bays of the south side of the structure .

Johann Sebastian Bach 's Prelude and Fugue in D major , BWV 532.2 ( previously 532 ) , is a prelude and fugue written for the organ , and has an approximate duration of minutes . BWV 532.1 ( previously 532/2a ) is an earlier version of the Fugue .
History
The Fugue in D major , BWV 532a , was composed around 1708 . It is an earlier version of fugue of BWV 532 . Not much is known about this fugue , other than that it was composed around 2 years before the Prelude and Fugue in D Major , and was written and premiered in Weimar . Also BWV 532 was written during Bach 's tenure in Weimar : it was composed between 1709 and 1717 . Many of his greatest and most well known organ works were written during this period , including , for example , the Prelude and Fugue in E major , BWV 566 . The composer was residing in Weimar after being hired by the ruling duke of Weimar , Wilhelm Ernst , in 1709 as an organist and member of the court orchestra ; he was particularly encouraged to make use of his unique talents with the organ by the duke . Indeed , his fame on the instrument grew and he was visited by many students of the organ to hear him play and to try to learn from his technique . The Prelude and Fugue in D major was probably composed in 1710 , although this is not certain . What we do know is that BWV 532 features a lengthy , complex , self-contained fugue preceded by a multisectional prelude . Thus it must have been written before Bach codified the clear two-section prelude and fugue form used in The Well-Tempered Clavier , which was composed in 1722 .
Structure
The piece is in two sections : a prelude and a fugue . Both the sections are in D major but , to begin with , there is no tempo marking given on either section . Both pieces are in 4/4 .
Prelude
The prelude commences with a semi-quaver scale from the pedals , and then the manuals begin with an intricate quaver pattern between the hands . Another run from the pedals is then followed by a continuation of the quaver pattern from the right-hand . The quaver pattern then repeats one octave lower . The pedals then play arpeggiated patterns which begin a repeated theme and slow down throughout . This lasts for four bars . A sustained pedal then accompanies the manuals , which have a dotted quaver , semi-quaver rhythm . This then turns into a repeated G♯ , B demi-semi-quaver rhythm . This then slows to a series of repeated cadences .
A new phrase then begins with an ascending scale in the manuals leading up to a large D major chord . A new tempo is then introduced : Alla breve , and then a large phrase is introduced with a very polyphonic texture and a prominent tune . A section then starts with chords played in the manuals and the quavers played in the pedals . This continues for another long period of time until the left hand takes the tune and the right hand plays the quavers .
When this section finishes , a new tempo of Adagio begins . A new theme then arrives with slow quavers on the lower manual and pedal and ascending scales in the upper manual . The prelude then concludes with a slow theme , on broken arpeggios and some slow , elongated final chords .
Fugue
The subject of this fugue is eight measures long and consists of tight figurations encompassing the interval of a ninth . Bach takes this subject firstly through the relative minor and then the mediant minor , and then to the minor harmony of the leading tone and the major harmony on the supertonic . After this progression we enter an episode with a flurry of figures on the dominant and then a full entry of the subject on the tonic that works to resolve the preceding tension so well that the eventual coda almost has the nature of an afterthought .
The subjects of both the BWV 532a and 532 fugues are identical , as well are the counter-subject introduction in the alto voice , and then also in the tenor voice . The fugue in BWV 532a is identical to the one of BWV 532 until the 28th measure ( 7 measures after the introduction of the subject in the pedals ) .
Transcriptions
This work has been transcribed for solo piano by Ferruccio Busoni as BV B 20 in 1888 , and by Eugen d'Albert in 1893 .

Skull & Crossbones is a pirate-themed beat 'em up developed by Atari Games and released as an arcade video game in 1989 . Developer Tengen ported the game to the Amiga , Amstrad CPC , Atari ST , Commodore 64 , MS-DOS , Nintendo Entertainment System , and ZX Spectrum .
The game is playable in single and co-op modes , where the objective of both players is to rescue their kidnapped princess from the antagonist , a wizard . Player one controls One-Eye , and player two controls Red Dog . Gameplay consists of players fighting through waves of enemies and level bosses , such as Medusa and Ship Captains , collecting weapons and booty to become increasingly powerful . Collectable items are centred around the pirate theme , such as the cutlass or flintlock pistol .
Reception of Skulls & Crossbones was mixed to positive , with magazines like The One praising the pirate atmosphere and innovative twist on the beat 'em up genre .
Gameplay
The game 's player characters are One-Eye ( player one ) and Red Dog ( player two ) , pirates on an adventure to find a wizard who kidnapped their princess . In order to rescue their princess , they must collect weapons and booty . The booty is traded for weapons at the end of each level . The weapons the player receives and how much of each weapon is dependent on what types and how much of each type of booty the player collected . Collecting weapons and booty is absolutely necessary in this game , as the default punch attack is not very powerful and ultimately ineffective .
There are several different types of weapons and booty to collect in each level , though not all weapon types appear in every level . Of the three major weapon types that appear in most levels , the cutlass is the weakest and only has a slightly longer range than the punch . However , a cutlass is not wasted if it does not hit an enemy . The knife is the mid-level weapon and is similar to the knife weapon in Castlevania . The player throws this weapon in a straight line in front of them . The flintlock pistol is more powerful than both the cutlass and the knife , firing a musket ball straight in front of the player .
To complete each level , the player must defeat 15 enemies and a level boss . Skull & Crossbones has seven game levels . In some ports of the game , the first six levels may be played in any sequence : One-Eye 's Ship , Spanish Castle , Pirate 's Ship # 1 , Ninja Camp , Pirate 's Ship # 2 , Beach Cave , and Pirate 's Ship # 3 . Once these levels are complete , the players go to the final level , the Wizard 's Lair .
In the arcade version the players are also given three opportunities to change the difficulty of the game , at the end of One-Eye 's Ship level and after the first two Pirates Ship levels , and have a chance to get an opportunity item in the Castle , Ninja Lair , and Beach Cave . However the levels are forcibly played in the written sequence above . In two-player mode , there are a few specific changes to how the game plays : except in the Pirate 's Ship levels , players must duel at the end of each level to see which gets an invulnerability item .
Each credit adds 50 health points to whichever player the credit was added for . Each level has a time limit that can be raised by obtaining hourglasses from killed enemies , but running out of time only results in slowly losing life and can be counteracted by buying additional credits .
Each of the two player pirates behaves the same and face either left or right but can turn with the appropriate button . The sword button can be pressed to block and the joystick can be used in combination with the button to throw various attacks , thrusts and stabs . Red X 's appear often denoting jumps and cranks , and white crosses can be dug up with the sword button to obtain various treasures . A parrot belonging to the pirate constantly flies with the players and recites roughly twelve different lines nonstop . The parrots only appear in the arcade version .
Each of the three pirate ship levels has a Pirate Captain boss at the end of the level and a woman referred to in the game as a wench , while the other three levels have an Executioner ( a heavy hitter ) , Monk ( a fast attacker ) , and Medusa ( a turret ) boss for their respective stages . The Medusa 's attacks can be avoided altogether by facing away and using back-stabs ; if the players have chosen the easiest difficulty , an onscreen hint advises them not to look at Medusa . In the Wizard 's Lair , these bosses are encountered again in order and the player who grabbed the invulnerability item on their respective stages immediately regains the use of that item for a duration . The wizard boss at the end will appear on one side of the room and launch Wizard Balls that stun the player and when attacked will teleport to the other side and continue . After several hits the player will behead him and will be given a chance to pick up some last wealth items before the game is proclaimed to be over soon afterwards .
Reception
The One gave the Amiga version of Skull & Crossbones an overall score of 77 % , noting it as `` a slight deviation from the usual beat 'em up fare , and it gives the genre a couple of unusual twists . '' The One praises Skull & Crossbones ' graphics and music , stating that the graphics `` convey the action well enough and , together with a brace of catchy tunes , they help create the perfect pirate atmosphere '' and express that the two-player mode adds `` a lot more fun , since you 've got the added element of fighting over who gets the extra energy and money . '' The One concludes that `` [ Skull & Crossbones ] is n't the greatest or most polished beat 'em up in existence '' but is 'good and entertaining ' .

The Anglican Church of St Michael in Orchard Portman , Somerset , England , dates from the Norman period . It is a Grade II * listed building .
History
The church was built in the Norman period . The chancel was rebuilt in the early 15th century and the tower around 1540 , with further building work in the 19th and 20th centuries .
The church formed part of the former Portman family estate . The Portman chapel was erected as the south aisle around 1450 , demolished in 1844 and rebuilt again in 1910 .
The parish is part of the Seven Sowers benefice which includes Beercrocombe , Curry Mallet , Stoke St Mary , Hatch Beauchamp , Staple Fitzpaine and West Hatch . It is within the Diocese of Bath and Wells .
Architecture
The church consists of a chancel , vestry , three-bay nave and south chapel . The chancel has a wagon roof with plastered barrel vault . The crenellated three-stage tower is supported by diagonal buttresses .
Inside the church is a hexagonal Jacobean style pulpit . There is some medieval stained glass ; however , most is from the 19th and 20th centuries .
Dr Thomas Bond ( 1841–1901 ) a British physician considered by some to be the first offender profiler , and best known for his association with the notorious Jack the Ripper murders of 1888 , was buried in the churchyard .

Sidney Kilner Levett-Yeats ( c. 1858–1916 ) , an English novelist known professionally as S. Levett-Yeats , was the descendant of an old English trading family with connections to British India . S. Levett-Yeats became a soldier with the Indian Army and later joined the Indian Civil Service as a low-level bureaucrat . Inspired by the example of other ambitious Anglo-Indian writers like Rudyard Kipling , Levett-Yeats turned out a series of Victorian potboilers , often set in Europe , that earned him a place on the bestseller lists of the day .
Family
Levett-Yeats was descended from Francis Levett , an English factor working for the Levant Company in Livorno , Italy , who later moved to British East Florida to become a planter . Levett 's daughter married Dr. David Yeats , a physician who was the Secretary of the East Florida Colony in Florida . The Levetts were an old Anglo-Norman family who grew rich building one of the first large English multinational trading firms , Sir Richard Levett & Co . In that capacity , the family traded around the globe , and Sir Richard Levett , Lord Mayor of London , served as an early member of the London East India Company . Sidney Levett-Yeats was born in England , the son of Charles Levett-Yeats . His father , who died in 1878 , was Under-Secretary to the Government of Bombay . His mother was the former Caroline Smith , daughter of James Smith , Esq. , of Satara district , Maharashtra , India , where the couple were married at St Thomas ' Church in 1857 .
Levett-Yeats ' brother Gerald Aylmer ( known professionally as G.A . Levett-Yeats ) was also a writer , as well as an illustrator , particularly of books relating to the fauna and flora of the subcontinent and the East . G.A . Levett-Yeats ( 1863–1938 ) lived in Calcutta , and was best known for his illustrations for the books The Birds of Singapore Island and The Common Birds of India . Like his brother , G.A . Levett-Yeats began his career in the Indian civil service , in his case as `` sub-deputy opium inspector '' in the `` Opium Department '' in Bengal . G.A . Levett-Yeats ' own book about India of 1898 carried the title : India : In the Land of the White Poppy . His other book about India was called My Indian Garden .
Early career
Sidney Levett-Yeats ' career began as a soldier in the Brithis Indian Army , where he served as Lieutenant in the Punjab Light Horse . He later entered the British government civil service in the Punjab , where he began writing fiction on the side . His title within Her Majesty 's Government was Deputy Examiner in the Public Works Department , and he served 15 years in the department . But as his career as a popular novelist took off , he eventually received a furlough from his civil service job in India and returned to England .
Novels
Levett-Yeats set his boisterous novels in wildly different locales , and his novels struck a chord with an English audience enamoured of historical romance . The genre was so popular that it was known as the 'cloak and sword school . ' The Lord Protector , for instance , set in the days of the English Commonwealth under Oliver Cromwell , describes the hunting down of an ardent Royalist . A Galahad of the Creeks was set during the Burmese wars . The Chevalier d'Auriac concerned Henry of Navarre . Other tales were set in swashbuckling Europe . Orrain : A Romance , published by Methuen in London and by Longmans in the United States , told a tale of King Henry II of France and his wife Catherine de ' Medici . The Chevalier d'Auriac was serialized in Longman 's Magazine in 1897 .
Levett 's best-known book was The Honour of Savelli , a tale of treachery and intrigue set during the era of the Borgias in medieval Italy . The work , noted a review in the magazine Book Reviews , captured Levett 's strong suit : his storytelling ability . `` The freedom and dash of his recital , and the general ability shown in the handling of his characters and in the quality of his style are his strongest credentials , '' noted the review .
Critique
The Honour of Savelli even made Levett-Yeats ' friend from Lahore 's Punjab Club , Rudyard Kipling , sit up and take notice . `` When I knew him in the Punjab Club in the old days , '' Kipling wrote to a friend about Levett-Yeats , `` he was full of notions about a mutiny tale and he may have something up his sleeve that would be worth getting at . ''
Levett-Yeats had a flair for story , but the critics were not always impressed by his writing style . `` He has romance and pretty turn for dramatic episodes , '' said The New York Tribune about his book The Heart of Denise and Other Tales . `` The Indian tales show that while Mr. Yeats is far below Mr. Kipling in the treatment of the material to be found among the natives , he is at any rate clever and readable . His vignettes of landscape are drawn with special grace . ''
Style
Levett 's novels were the equivalent of today 's action movies : full of chase scenes , dramatic battles and high-strung melodrama . The gist of Levett-Yeats ' Chevalier d'Auriac , said The New York Times , `` is the way the King reveals his true manliness and gives over Mme . de Tremouille to the Chevalier , who had wooed her so long and undergone so many dangers on her account . '' Perhaps more darkly , The Times hinted in its review of such astonishing similarities between Levett 's book and that of another popular writer of the day , Stanley J. Weyman , that , it declared , `` were it not for the author 's name and preface , the average reader would certainly believe ( it ) to be another work from the facile pen of Mr . Weyman . ''
For English novelists of the age , India offered a beguiling chance to explore the exotic and the raffish . Levett-Yeats began with tales of the East , before moving on mostly to stories set among the jousters of medieval Europe . `` India still remains a favorite hunting-ground of the novelist , and the field of Mr. Kipling and Mrs. Steel is this week re-occupied by Mr. S. Levett-Yeats , who is well-known at the libraries by reason of his successful story , 'The Honour of Savelli , ' '' said the New York magazine The Critic in 1897 . Because of his service as soldier , bureaucrat and traveller on the Indian subcontinent , noted the magazine , `` he has therefore had abundant opportunity for observing the things which he describes . ''
Later life
Unlike Kipling , who stayed with the characters and literary topography he mined in India , Levett-Yeats was driven by temperament or the demands of readers and the marketplace to stray further afield . He returned to England , where he lived as a successful , although mostly critically ignored , commercial novelist . Unlike Kipling , Levett-Yeats seemed more interested in rewards of the pocketbook rather than paeans from the critics , and by that measure , at least , he seems to have been a success .
In his retelling of medieval legends that echoed King Arthur , Levett-Yeats provided a window into the British colonial mind at the end of the nineteenth century . Some scholars now suggest that Levett-Yeats ' tales of chivalric derring-do mask a deeper insecurity about the English mandate in India . Underlying the romance of Levett-Yeats ' tales , they suggest , is a darker world view , tinctured by the challenges to British authority in the Punjab after the Indian Rebellion of 1857 , which demonstrated how tenuous the East India Company 's hold was on an enormous nation . Levett-Yeats anachronistic tales of distressed damsels and heroic knights might have been the tonic England needed at the time .
In 1906 he married a lady named Mildred Eagles , and after this date , he does not appear to have published anything . He was awarded the Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire ( C.I.E . ) in recognition of his services in India .
Levett-Yeats was a member of the Savage Club in London , as well as the Punjab and United Service Clubs in Lucknow . He listed his hobbies as `` riding , shooting and hunting . ''
Sidney Kilner Levett-Yeats died at Steyning , West Sussex , in 1916 .

The Marang District is a coastal district in Terengganu , Malaysia . The district seat is the town of Marang . The districts that border Marang are Kuala Terengganu and Kuala Nerus to the north , Hulu Terengganu in the west , while Dungun is in the south . The eastern part of the district is a stretch of coastline facing the South China Sea .
Etymology
The origin of the district 's name is attributed to a Chinese entrepreneur of dried sea products known only by the name of Ma ( 馬 , literally horses ) , who was one of the first settlers in the area . The sea products , consisting of fish and squid , are dried on racks called rang by the local populace . Given Ma owned all the rangs , the area became known as Ma rang ( i.e . 'Ma 's rangs '' ' ) , which eventually became Marang .
History
The administrative history of Marang began in the reign of Baginda Omar ( r. 1839-1876 ) , the ninth Sultan of Terengganu , with the appointment of noblemen governing riverine districts , whereby the governing noble would administer the collection of taxes and revenue on behalf of the Sultan . Previously , the power to collect taxes was in the hands of village heads ; they were now only responsible for village-level administration . The new system greatly improved tax and revenue collection and increased local administration efficiency . Present-day Marang district was divided into four riverine districts , Marang , Bukit Payong , Alor Limbat and Merchang .
In 1912 , the nobility-based district administration was replaced by professional District Officers . The Marang District Office Building was erected in Marang town in 1915 . However , in 1923 , during the reign of Sultan Sulaiman Badrul Alam Shah ( r. 1920-1942 ) , the British Adviser , J.L . Humpherys , led a reorganization of district-level administration . The riverine districts were abolished and replaced with three dependencies ( ) . The Marang and Merchang riverine districts were lumped with Kuala Berang and Kuala Terengganu into a new Central Dependency . Each dependency was headed by a Commissioner and assisted by an Assistant British Adviser .
Geography and demographics
Marang has an area of 666 km² . The district 's topography consists of the South China Sea coast , peat swamps , hills and plains . The sub-districts ( ) of Rusila , Pulau Kerengga and Merchang lie on the coast with sandy plains gradually giving way to hills in the interior . The Jerong sub-district is mainly hilly , while the sub-districts of Bukit Payong and Alor Limbat consist of rolling plains and peat swamps . The district 's population of 84,938 ( 2000 census ) is 97.2 % rural and predominantly Malays ( 97.2 % ) while the Chinese are the biggest ethnic minority ( 2.6 % ) . Most people in Marang use the Marang sub-dialect of Terengganu Malay .

Hailar District , formerly a county-level city , is an urban district that serves as the seat of the prefecture-level city Hulunbuir in northeastern Inner Mongolia , China . Hulunbuir , due to its massive size , is a city in administrative terms only , being mainly grassland and rural .
Long known as the `` Pearl of the Grasslands '' , Hailar acts as a gateway between China and Russia . The district spans an area of 1,319.8 square kilometers , and has an estimated population of 365,000 as of 2010 . The district serves as a regional center for commerce , trade , and transportation .
History
Hailar was founded as a Chinese fort in 1734 , and during the administration of the Republic of China , it was the capital city of Xing'an Province . It was a center of agricultural production on the historical Chinese Eastern Railway . Once known as Hulun , Hailar today is a relatively small , but thriving modern industrial city of around 300,000 , its population having soared from an estimated 20,000 in the mid-20th century .
After the Mukden Incident in 1931 , Japan invaded China 's northeastern provinces and established the puppet state of Manzhouguo . Hailar Fortress , a huge underground Japanese fortress , was completed in 1937 by forced Chinese laborers . The Kwantung Army garrisoned in Manchuria built the fortress complex as one of the biggest Japanese fortifications in Manchuria . Some of the fiercest fighting of the Soviet–Japanese War in August 1945 took place around Hailar . Prisoners of war and civilians were massacred by the Kwantung Army in August 1945 during the final month of World War II . The World Anti-fascist War Hailar Memorial Park , a museum and war memorial , is built on the site of the Hailar Fortress , parts of the fortress tunnels are open for public viewing .
Transportation
Hulunbuir Hailar Airport serves the city , with flights to Beijing and Shenyang amongst others . Hailar 's railway station is the penultimate major station before Manzhouli , the port city that stands close to the Russian border . It is on the famous Western line of the Trans-Siberian express route and China National Highway 301 . Trains to Harbin take about 12 hours , and 27 to Beijing . Hailar has a frequent series of buses that cover the town .
Geography
Hailar is located in close proximity to the Greater Xing'an Mountains , and has an elevation ranging from . Of the city 's 1,319.8 square kilometers , 28 square kilometers ( or 2.12 % ) of the district is urban .
Administrative divisions
Hailar is divided into 6 subdistricts and 2 towns : Zhengyang Subdistrict , Kaoshan Subdistrict , Jiankang Subdistrict , Shengli Subdistrict , Hulun Subdistrict , Jianshe Subdistrict , Fendou , and Hake .
Climate
Hailar has a humid continental climate ( Köppen Dwb ) bordering on a subarctic climate ( Köppen Dwc ) . Winters are long , very dry and severe , due to the semi−permanent Siberian High , while summers are short , though very warm , and rather wet , due to the East Asian monsoon . The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from in January to in July , while the annual mean is . With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 55 % in December to 69 % in February , sunshine is abundant year-round , and the annual total is 2,719 hours . More than two-thirds of the annual rainfall occurs during the three summer months . The Mohe-Huma-Hailar triangle between northern Heilongjiang and Northeastern Inner Mongolia , which almost equivalent to China 's subarctic climate zone , suffers the most severe cold winter in China .
Culture
Hailar is a multi-ethnic town , with notable Han , Mongolian , Hui , Daur , Evenki , Russian populations . As such , signs are usually bilingual and Mongolian influence pervades in songs played on shop CD players , domes on buildings and the everyday speech of some locals .
Composer Vladimir Ussachevsky was born in Hailar , as well as leading news anchor Bai Yansong ; the folk metal band Nine Treasures also originated in Hailar .

A definite clause grammar ( DCG ) is a way of expressing grammar , either for natural or formal languages , in a logic programming language such as Prolog . It is closely related to the concept of attribute grammars / affix grammars from which Prolog was originally developed .
DCGs are usually associated with Prolog , but similar languages such as Mercury also include DCGs . They are called definite clause grammars because they represent a grammar as a set of definite clauses in first-order logic .
The term DCG refers to the specific type of expression in Prolog and other similar languages ; not all ways of expressing grammars using definite clauses are considered DCGs . However , all of the capabilities or properties of DCGs will be the same for any grammar that is represented with definite clauses in essentially the same way as in Prolog .
The definite clauses of a DCG can be considered a set of axioms where the validity of a sentence , and the fact that it has a certain parse tree can be considered theorems that follow from these axioms . This has the advantage of making it so that recognition and parsing of expressions in a language becomes a general matter of proving statements , such as statements in a logic programming language .
History
The history of DCGs is closely tied to the history of Prolog , and the history of Prolog revolves around several researchers in both Marseille , France , and Edinburgh , Scotland . According to Robert Kowalski , an early developer of Prolog , the first Prolog system was developed in 1972 by Alain Colmerauer and Phillipe Roussel . The first program written in the language was a large natural-language processing system . Fernando Pereira and David Warren at the University of Edinburgh were also involved in the early development of Prolog .
Colmerauer had previously worked on a language processing system called Q-systems that was used to translate between English and French . In 1978 , Colmerauer wrote a paper about a way of representing grammars called metamorphosis grammars which were part of the early version of Prolog called Marseille Prolog . In this paper , he gave a formal description of metamorphosis grammars and some examples of programs that use them .
Fernando Pereira and David Warren , two other early architects of Prolog , coined the term `` definite clause grammar '' and created the notation for DCGs that is used in Prolog today . They gave credit for the idea to Colmerauer and Kowalski , and they note that DCGs are a special case of Colmerauer 's metamorphosis grammars . They introduced the idea in an article called `` Definite Clause Grammars for Language Analysis '' , where they describe DCGs as a `` formalism ... in which grammars are expressed clauses of first-order predicate logic '' that `` constitute effective programs of the programming language Prolog '' .
Pereira , Warren , and other pioneers of Prolog later wrote about several other aspects of DCGs . Pereira and Warren wrote an article called `` Parsing as Deduction '' , describing things such as how the Earley Deduction proof procedure is used for parsing . Pereira also collaborated with Stuart M. Shieber on a book called `` Prolog and Natural Language Analysis '' , that was intended as a general introduction to computational linguistics using logic programming .
Example
A basic example of DCGs helps to illustrate what they are and what they look like .
sentence -- > noun_phrase , verb_phrase .
noun_phrase -- > det , noun .
verb_phrase -- > verb , noun_phrase .
det -- > [ the ] .
det -- > [ a ] .
noun -- > [ cat ] .
noun -- > [ bat ] .
verb -- > [ eats ] .
This generates sentences such as `` the cat eats the bat '' , `` a bat eats the cat '' . One can generate all of the valid expressions in the language generated by this grammar at a Prolog interpreter by typing sentence ( X , [ ] ) . Similarly , one can test whether a sentence is valid in the language by typing something like sentence ( [ the , bat , eats , the , bat ] , [ ] ) .
Translation into definite clauses
DCG notation is just syntactic sugar for normal definite clauses in Prolog . For example , the previous example could be translated into the following :
sentence ( A , Z ) : - noun_phrase ( A , B ) , verb_phrase ( B , Z ) .
noun_phrase ( A , Z ) : - det ( A , B ) , noun ( B , Z ) .
verb_phrase ( A , Z ) : - verb ( A , B ) , noun_phrase ( B , Z ) .
det ( [ the|X ] , X ) .
det ( [ a|X ] , X ) .
noun ( [ cat|X ] , X ) .
noun ( [ bat|X ] , X ) .
verb ( [ eats|X ] , X ) .
Difference lists
The arguments to each functor , such as ( A , B ) and ( B , Z ) are difference lists ; difference lists are a way of representing a prefix of a list as the difference between its two suffixes ( the bigger including the smaller one ) . Using Prolog 's notation for lists , a singleton list prefix P = [ H ] can be seen as the difference between [ H|X ] and X , and thus represented with the pair ( [ H|X ] , X ) , for instance .
Saying that P is the difference between A and B is the same as saying that append ( P , B , A ) holds . Or in the case of the previous example , append ( [ H ] , X , [ H|X ] ) .
Difference lists are used to represent lists with DCGs for reasons of efficiency . It is much more efficient to concatenate list differences ( prefixes ) , in the circumstances that they can be used , because the concatenation of ( A , B ) and ( B , Z ) is just ( A , Z ) .
Indeed , append ( P , B , A ) , append ( Q , Z , B ) entails append ( P , Q , S ) , append ( S , Z , A ) . This is the same as saying that list concatenation is associative :
A = P + B = P + ( Q + Z ) = ( P + Q ) + Z = S + Z = A
Non-context-free grammars
In pure Prolog , normal DCG rules with no extra arguments on the functors , such as the previous example , can only express context-free grammars ; there is only one argument on the left side of the production . However , context-sensitive grammars can also be expressed with DCGs , by providing extra arguments , such as in the following example :
s -- > a ( N ) , b ( N ) , c ( N ) .
a ( 0 ) -- > [ ] .
a ( M ) -- > [ a ] , a ( N ) , { M is N + 1 } .
b ( 0 ) -- > [ ] .
b ( M ) -- > [ b ] , b ( N ) , { M is N + 1 } .
c ( 0 ) -- > [ ] .
c ( M ) -- > [ c ] , c ( N ) , { M is N + 1 } .
This set of DCG rules describes the grammar which generates the language that consists of strings of the form .
s -- > symbols ( Sem , a ) , symbols ( Sem , b ) , symbols ( Sem , c ) .
symbols ( end , _ ) -- > [ ] .
symbols ( s ( Sem ) , S ) -- > [ S ] , symbols ( Sem , S ) .
This set of DCG rules describes the grammar which generates the language that consists of strings of the form , by structurally representing
Representing features
Various linguistic features can also be represented fairly concisely with DCGs by providing extra arguments to the functors . For example , consider the following set of DCG rules :
sentence -- > pronoun ( subject ) , verb_phrase .
verb_phrase -- > verb , pronoun ( object ) .
pronoun ( subject ) -- > [ he ] .
pronoun ( subject ) -- > [ she ] .
pronoun ( object ) -- > [ him ] .
pronoun ( object ) -- > [ her ] .
verb -- > [ likes ] .
This grammar allows sentences like `` he likes her '' and `` he likes him '' , but not `` her likes he '' and `` him likes him '' .
Parsing with DCGs
The main practical use of a DCG is to parse sentences of the given grammar , i.e . to construct a parse tree . This can be done by providing `` extra arguments '' to the functors in the DCG , like in the following rules :
sentence ( s ( NP , VP ) ) -- > noun_phrase ( NP ) , verb_phrase ( VP ) .
noun_phrase ( np ( D , N ) ) -- > det ( D ) , noun ( N ) .
verb_phrase ( vp ( V , NP ) ) -- > verb ( V ) , noun_phrase ( NP ) .
det ( d ( the ) ) -- > [ the ] .
det ( d ( a ) ) -- > [ a ] .
noun ( n ( bat ) ) -- > [ bat ] .
noun ( n ( cat ) ) -- > [ cat ] .
verb ( v ( eats ) ) -- > [ eats ] .
One can now query the interpreter to yield a parse tree of any given sentence :
| ? - sentence ( Parse_tree , [ the , bat , eats , a , cat ] , [ ] ) .
Parse_tree = s ( np ( d ( the ) , n ( bat ) ) , vp ( v ( eats ) , np ( d ( a ) , n ( cat ) ) ) ) ? ;
Other uses
DCGs can serve as a convenient syntactic sugar to hide certain parameters in code in other places besides parsing applications .
In the declaratively pure programming language Mercury I/O must be represented by a pair of io.state arguments .
DCG notation can be used to make using I/O more convenient , although state variable notation is usually preferred .
DCG notation is also used for parsing and similar things in Mercury as it is in Prolog .
Extensions
Since DCGs were introduced by Pereira and Warren , several extensions have been proposed . Pereira himself proposed an extension called extraposition grammars ( XGs ) . This formalism was intended in part to make it easier to express certain grammatical phenomena , such as left-extraposition . Pereira states , `` The difference between XG rules and DCG rules is then that the left-hand side of an XG rule may contain several symbols . '' This makes it easier to express rules for context-sensitive grammars .
Peter Van Roy extended DCGs to allow multiple accumulators .
Another , more recent , extension was made by researchers at NEC Corporation called Multi-Modal Definite Clause Grammars ( MM-DCGs ) in 1995 . Their extensions were intended to allow the recognizing and parsing expressions that include non-textual parts such as pictures .
Another extension , called definite clause translation grammars ( DCTGs ) was described by Harvey Abramson in 1984 . DCTG notation looks very similar to DCG notation ; the major difference is that one uses : := instead of -- > in the rules . It was devised to handle grammatical attributes conveniently . The translation of DCTGs into normal Prolog clauses is like that of DCGs , but 3 arguments are added instead of 2 .

In statics , the block-stacking problem ( sometimes known as The Leaning Tower of Lire , also the book-stacking problem , or a number of other similar terms ) is a puzzle concerning the stacking of blocks at the edge of a table .
Statement
The block-stacking problem is the following puzzle :
Place identical rigid rectangular blocks in a stable stack on a table edge in such a way as to maximize the overhang .
provide a long list of references on this problem going back to mechanics texts from the middle of the 19th century .
Variants
Single-wide
The single-wide problem involves having only one block at any given level . In the ideal case of perfectly rectangular blocks , the solution to the single-wide problem is that the maximum overhang is given by times the width of a block . This sum is one half of the corresponding partial sum of the harmonic series . Because the harmonic series diverges , the maximal overhang tends to infinity as increases , meaning that it is possible to achieve any arbitrarily large overhang , with sufficient blocks .
The number of blocks required to reach at least block-lengths past the edge of the table is 4 , 31 , 227 , 1674 , 12367 , 91380 , ... .
Multi-wide
Multi-wide stacks using counterbalancing can give larger overhangs than a single width stack . Even for three blocks , stacking two counterbalanced blocks on top of another block can give an overhang of 1 , while the overhang in the simple ideal case is at most . As showed , asymptotically , the maximum overhang that can be achieved by multi-wide stacks is proportional to the cube root of the number of blocks , in contrast to the single-wide case in which the overhang is proportional to the logarithm of the number of blocks . However , it has been shown that in reality this is impossible and the number of blocks that we can move to the right , due to block stress , is not more than a specified number . For example , for a special brick with = , Young 's modulus = and density = and limiting compressive stress , the approximate value of will be 853 and the maximum tower height becomes .
Robustness
discusses this problem , shows that it is robust to nonidealizations such as rounded block corners and finite precision of block placing , and introduces several variants including nonzero friction forces between adjacent blocks .

Production
Development
Warner Bros. Pictures and DC Films were developing a film based on Jaime Reyes / Blue Beetle by the end of November 2018 , with Mexican-born Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer writing the screenplay . Zev Foreman was executive producing the project for Warner Bros. , which was set to be the first DC Extended Universe ( DCEU ) film starring a Latino lead . By December 2020 , DC Films was planning to release several mid-budget films a year exclusively on the streaming service HBO Max , rather than in theaters , as part of new DC Films president Walter Hamada 's plan for the DCEU , with Blue Beetle listed as one such project in 2021 . Puerto Rican Angel Manuel Soto was hired to direct the film in February 2021 . In April , Blue Beetle was included on DC 's slate of films that were expected to be released in 2022 or 2023 . John Rickard was producing the film for HBO Max by that August , when filming was expected to begin in early 2022 . In December 2021 , Warner Bros. revealed that the film would be receiving a theatrical release in August 2023 instead of being produced directly for HBO Max . In mid-April 2022 , Soto and cinematographer Pawel Pogorzelski visited El Paso , Texas , to meet with local artists , muralists , musicians , and historians to understand the feel of the city . S & K Pictures , and the Safran Company co-produce the film alongside DC Films .
Writing
Soto had described Dunnet-Alcocer 's script as emphasizing `` the Latino family at its core '' , a sentiment also echoed by Maridueña , who had said `` the family aspect to this movie and to the character is inherent to the comics and so special '' . Sarandon later revealed that multiple scenes in the film will be spoken in Spanish , with subtitles being provided .
Casting
Xolo Maridueña was Soto 's first choice to portray Reyes , with Soto explaining that he `` could n't stop seeing [ Maridueña ] as the character '' since he was hired to direct the film . Soto and Warner Bros. offered the role to Maridueña on August 1 , 2021 , he was publicly revealed to be in talks for the film the next day , and his casting was officially confirmed later that day at the premiere for the DCEU film The Suicide Squad . When learning of the role , Maridueña was most excited that Reyes is a Latino character and he could bring Latino representation to a superhero project .
In early March , Bruna Marquezine was cast as Reyes 's love interest , Penny , with Belissa Escobedo playing Reyes 's sister Milagros , and Harvey Guillén cast in an undisclosed role . Later that month , the rest of Reyes 's family was cast : George Lopez as uncle Rudy , Adriana Barraza as Nana , Elpidia Carrillo as Rocio , and Damián Alcázar as Alberto . Soto said he wanted to create an authentic Mexican family with real accents and experiences , and also wanted the elder members of the family to be portrayed by `` beloved '' Mexican actors from Latin American cinema who had also crossed over to United States cinema and paved the way for members of the younger generation , such as Maridueña and Escobedo . By the end of March , Sharon Stone was in talks to play the villain Victoria Kord , an original creation for the film which was believed to be the wife of Ted Kord , the second Blue Beetle in the comics . Raoul Trujillo also joined the cast then as Carapax the Indestructible Man . In mid-April , Susan Sarandon was cast as Victoria Kord after negotiations with Stone ended .
Filming
Principal photography began by May 25 , 2022 , taking place in the Atlanta metropolitan area , primarily at Wilder Studios in Decatur , Georgia , using the working title Mofongo . Pawel Pogorzelski served as the cinematographer . Filming also occurred in El Paso and Puerto Rico . Sarandon completed filming her scenes by the end of June , and Trujillo said in early July that filming was almost complete . Filming wrapped on July 18 in Puerto Rico .
Marketing
Soto , Dunnet-Alcocer , and Maridueña promoted the film at the virtual DC FanDome event in October 2021 , where they discussed their preparation for filming and revealed concept art for the film .
Release
Blue Beetle is scheduled for theatrical release in the United States on August 18 , 2023 . A screening in El Paso is also planned . It was originally intended to be an HBO Max original streaming film .

Radovan Vujanović ( born 18 February 1982 in Aranđelovac , then Yugoslavia , now Serbia ) is an Austro-Serbian football player .
Career
Vujanović began his football career at his home town club FK Šumadija Aranđelovac before moving to Vienna . There he played for the amateur team of SK Rapid Wien , then Favoritner AC and DSV Fortuna 05 , before he joined FK Austria Wien in January 2004 , playing 14 matches in the third-tier Regionalliga Ost . His 19 goals for the club aroused interest from German third-tier side SC Paderborn who signed Vujanović in January 2005 .
With his new club he won promotion to the 2 . Fußball-Bundesliga and played four matches in Germany 's professional second-tier league before joining Regionalliga Süd side SV Wehen in January 2006 . Despite scoring three goals in eleven matches , Vujanović moved on in the summer 2006 , joining Kickers Emden in the Regionalliga Nord . After initial difficulties he established himself as a regular , scoring 22 goals in 60 matches .
After his Emden contract ran out , Vujanović joined 1 . FC Magdeburg at the beginning of the 2007–08 season . He became a first team regular and was the only player to appear in all 34 matches in that season , also becoming the club 's top scorer with 20 goals . For the 2009–10 season , Vujanović was made captain . When Magdeburg missed out on promotion to the 3 . Liga , Vujanović dissolved his contract and joined FC Hansa Rostock for the 2010–11 season . He signed for Preußen Münster on loan in August 2011 .

The New Democratic Forces ( French : Forces démocratiques nouvelles ) was a political party in Congo-Brazzaville from 2007 to 2011 .
Seven parties , which were formerly members of the United Democratic Forces ( FDU ) , agreed to merge to form the FDN on 27 March 2007 . They were joined by an additional eight parties and political associations on 10 April , resulting in a total of 15 : ACOSS , the URN , the UNDP , the RDPC , Parrreco , PR-Le National , the RP , the MURC , the FNDP , CASAP , the ADP , Poucouna , the PPES , the PNDC , and the PPDS . One of them—the Union for National Recovery ( URN ) , led by Gabriel Bokilo—subsequently withdrew from the agreement . Like the FDU , the FDN supports President Denis Sassou Nguesso .
In the immediate aftermath of its formation , the FDN was headed by a collective of seven presidents . It then held its constitutive congress in Brazzaville on 19–21 April 2007 . This congress initiated a two-year transitional process in the development of the party . The congress elected a National Council with 415 members , a National Executive Bureau with seven members , a Permanent Secretariat with 41 members , and a Control and Evaluation Commission with seven members . The National Executive Bureau was jointly headed by Léon Alfred Opimbat and Jean-Marie Tassoua , while Emile Aurélien Bongouandé was chosen as coordinator of the Permanent Secretariat . In addition to Opimba and Tassou , the party 's co-presidents , four vice-presidents were chosen . On behalf of the new party , Opimbat and Tassoua signed an electoral agreement with Sassou Nguesso 's Congolese Labour Party ( PCT ) on 15 May 2007 .
In the parliamentary election held on 24 June and 5 August 2007 , the party won three out of 137 seats : Jean-Marie Tassoua in Dougou constituency ( in Likouala Region ) , Charlotte Opimbat in the first constituency of Poto-Poto ( in Brazzaville ) , and Léon Alfred Opimbat in Mbomo constituency ( in Cuvette West Region ) .
The FDN signed an agreement to join the Rally of the Presidential Majority ( RMP ) coalition on 27 March 2008 . It subsequently merged itself into the Congolese Labour Party ( PCT ) on 19 July 2011 .

Louise Emmons ( January 7 , 1858 – March 6 , 1935 ) was an American character actress . She appeared in several films between 1914 and 1935 .
Early years
Information about her early life is contradictory . Older sources give 1852 or 1861 as her birth year . An article in Classic Images in December 2016 states that she was born in 1872 as Louise Atkinson in California . She was of German descent . Allan Elleburger stated in 2017 that Emmons was born as Louie A. Adkison in 1858 near Camptonville , California . Elleberger says that `` got their start from the 1910 census ; even though she was in fact 52-years-old , she gave her age to the census enumerator as 37 ( making her two years younger than her husband ) '' .
Career
Louise Emmons worked for some time as a portrait artist . She already was at an advanced age when she made her first silent film in 1914 . With `` the kind of face that could stop a clock '' she appeared in over 65 films until 1935 , mostly in small roles . She specialized in portraying old hags , such as the evil headmistress from the Gang film Mush and Milk ( 1933 ) . Her last film was the horror movie Mark of the Vampire ( 1935 ) , where she played an old gypsy .
Personal life
Emmons married Roswell Emmons on April 21 , 1904 in Santa Barbara , California . They had one son . Her husband died in 1919 , leaving her a widow with a 12-year-son to raise .
Death
Emmons died in 1935 from heart disease and pneumonia at the Hollywood Hospital . She was buried in an unmarked grave at Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Los Angeles until her grave was given a marker on March 23 , 2014 .

Arseny Mikhailovich Avraamov ( ) ( born Krasnokutsky [ Краснокутский ] , 1886 died Moscow , 1944 ) was an avant-garde Russian composer and theorist . He studied at the music school of the Moscow Philharmonic Society , with private composition lessons from Sergey Taneyev . He refused to fight in World War I , and fled the country to work , among other things , as a circus artist . Returning in 1917 , he went on to compose his famous `` Simfoniya gudkov '' and was a pioneer in Russian sound on film techniques . Among his other achievements were the invention of graphic-sonic art , produced by drawing directly onto the optical sound track of film , and an `` Ultrachromatic '' 48-tone microtonal system , presented in his thesis , `` The Universal System of Tones , '' in Berlin , Frankfurt , and Stuttgart in 1927 . His microtonal system predated the creation of the Petrograd Society for Quarter-Tone Music in 1923 , by Georgii Rimskii-Korsakov .
Today , his most famous work is Simfoniya gudkov ( Гудковая симфония , `` Symphony of factory sirens '' ) . This piece involved navy ship sirens and whistles , bus and car horns , factory sirens , cannons , the foghorns of the entire Soviet flotilla in the Caspian Sea , artillery guns , machine guns , hydro-airplanes , a specially designed `` whistle main , '' and renderings of Internationale , Warszawianka and Marseillaise by a mass band and choir . The piece was conducted by a team of conductors using flags and pistols . It was performed in the city of Baku in 1922 , celebrating the fifth anniversary of the 1917 October Revolution , and less successfully in Moscow , a year later .

Goka Ramalingam ( 21 October 1921 – 1999 ) was an Indian politician of the Indian National Congress . He was a Member of the Legislative Assembly ( MLA ) for three consecutive terms from 1952 to 1967 .
In 1952 , Ramalingam won the by-election for the Bhongir constituency in the Hyderabad Legislative Assembly , defeating a member of the People 's Democratic Front by less than 300 votes . Ramalingam succeeded Ravi Narayana Reddy of the PDF , who had been elected to the 1st Lok Sabha in the 1952 Indian general election .
In 1956 , Hyderabad State was reorganized into Andhra Pradesh ; Ramalingam continued to represent the Bhongir constituency in the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly , the successor to the Hyderabad Legislative Assembly . In 1957 , Ramalingam successfully ran for re-election in the neighboring Jangaon constituency . He won re-election in Jangaon in 1962 .
In 1967 , Ramalingam ran for re-election in the neighboring Cheriyal constituency , a seat reserved for Scheduled Castes . He was defeated by Boddu Abraham of the Communist Party of India , receiving 12,735 compared to Abraham 's 15,195 , with K. Devadanam of the Swatantra Party placing third with 7,248 . However , Ramalingam contested the election , claiming that because both Abraham and Devadanam had converted to Christianity , they were no longer members of a Scheduled Caste , as the Constitution ( Scheduled Castes ) Order , 1950 stated that only Hindus and Sikhs could be members of a Scheduled Caste , with Ramalingam claiming that Abraham and Devadanam were thus ineligible to have run in the Cheriyal constituency . On 21 August 1967 , the Andhra Pradesh High Court ruled against Ramalingam and dismissed the case .
Goka Ramalingam 's younger brother Goka Ramaswamy was a Minister in the state of united Andhra Pradesh from 1978 to 1982 and a two-time MLA from Ghanpur ( Station ) constituency .

Sipho `` Hotstix '' Mabuse ( born in Johannesburg , 2 November 1951 ) is a South African singer .
Sipho grew up in Soweto . His mother was Zulu and his father was Tswana . Sipho and his band used to be managed by Solly Nkuta , After dropping out of school in the 1960s , Mabuse got his start in the Afro-soul group the Beaters in the mid-1970s . After a successful tour of Zimbabwe they changed the group 's name to Harari , an afrosoul band led by Mabuse . When they returned to their homeland in South Africa they began to draw almost exclusively on American-style funk , soul , and pop music , sung in Zulu and Sotho as well as English . He has also recorded and produced for , amongst others , Miriam Makeba , Hugh Masekela , Ray Phiri and Sibongile Khumalo .
Mabuse is responsible for `` Burn Out '' in the early 1980s which sold over 500,000 copies , and the giant ( Disco Shangaan ) hit of the late 1980s , `` Jive Soweto '' .
His daughter is the singer Mpho Skeef .
Mabuse returned to school at the age of 60 , completing his matric ( grade 12 ) in 2012 at Peter Lengene Community Learning Centre . He stated that he intended to continue on to college and study anthropology . President Jacob Zuma praised him for giving `` inspiration to all of us by showing us that one is never too old for education '' .
Allegations of unlawful enrichment at SAMRO
In 2019 the Southern African Music Rights Organisation ( SAMRO ) sued Mabuse for unlawful enrichment . According to the court case , Mabuse and a number of other members of the leadership of SAMRO overpaid themselves by more than R1.6 Million rand . Mabuse himself was irregularly overpaid by R171 000 .
SAMRO would later become the centre of a scandal regarding the underpayment of royalties to artists , much of this taking place during Mabuse 's time working for the organisation .
Bio
Sipho Cecil Peter Mabuse was born on 2 November 1951 in Masakeng ( Shantytown ) , Orlando West . At the tender age of 8 he began playing drums which he went on to master earning him the nickname “ Hotstix ” – a name that 's become synonymous with him to this day . He then went on to become a multi-instrumentalist through learning and mastering other instruments such as the flute , piano , saxophone , kalimba , timbales and African drums .
Sipho 's music career began when he formed a group called The Beaters with two of his friends Selby Ntuli and “ Om ” Alec Khaoli , when he was just 15 years old . After touring Zimbabwe ( Rhodesia ) in 1974 , and dedicating a song “ Harari ” to the people of that town , the group later changed its stage name to Harari –and went on to gain acclaim as one of the most successful acts that dominated the local music scene in the 70s with its “ feel good vibes of Afro-rock spiced with some get down boogie woogie space jabs ” , “ vibrating in percussion in toto , conga drumming and some breath taking wailing of flutes and pennywhisltes ” . . In 1978 , Harari was invited to perform in the USA with fellow musician Hugh Masekela , but the band 's leader Selby Ntuli died leaving Sipho as the new leader . Under the new frontman , the group went on to support and back renowned musicians such as Percy Sledge , Timmy Thomas , Letta Mbula , Brook Benton , and Wilson Pickett on their South African tours . In 1982 , the group split giving Sipho a chance to launch his solo career making him one of the pioneers of township pop while riding the wave of disco music .
In 1983 , Sipho released his crossover hit “ Burn Out ” which catapulted his solo career to stardom selling an excess of half a million copies and remains popular today . Some of his other popular songs include his 1986 hit Jive Soweto and the 1989 anti-apartheid anthem “ Chant of the Marching ” among others .
During his 50 plus year-long music career , Sipho has performed across Africa , Europe , and the USA .

American Flyers Airline Flight 280/D was a flight operated on a U.S. Military Air Command contract from Monterey Regional Airport in California to Columbus Airport in Georgia , via Ardmore Municipal Airport , Oklahoma . On April 22 , 1966 , while approaching Runway 8 at Ardmore , the aircraft overshot the runway and crashed into a hill , bursting into flames . Eighty-three of the 98 passengers and crew on board died as a result of the accident .
Aircraft
The aircraft was a Lockheed L-188 Electra four-engined turboprop airline registered as N183H . It had first flown in January 1961 and was bought by American Flyers Airline in January 1963 . It is the same plane that carried the Beatles from city to city in 1964 during their second tour of the U.S .
Investigation
The U.S. Civil Aeronautics Board ( CAB ) investigated the accident .
Investigators found no evidence of mechanical failure or defect . Some days after the crash , it was learned that the pilot , Reed Pigman , who also happened to be the president of American Flyers , was under care for arteriosclerosis . An autopsy of Pigman determined his cause of death to either be multiple injuries or coronary artery sclerosis .
It was also determined that Reed Pigman had falsified his application for a first-class medical certificate . He had not disclosed that he was diabetic or that he had a history of heart issues dating back almost two decades ; either of these would have been disqualifying factors for the certificate .
On March 28 , 1967 , the CAB published its final report . The CAB determined that the probable cause for the accident was :

Children 's Mercy Park is a soccer-specific stadium in Kansas City , Kansas , United States , and is the home of Sporting Kansas City . The stadium is located near Kansas Speedway , on the far west side of Wyandotte County , Kansas . It opened during the 2011 season of Major League Soccer on June 9 , 2011 with a match against the Chicago Fire . The stadium has a seating capacity of 18,467 seats , which can expand to 25,000 for concerts . Most SKC games attract around 21,000 because of different stadium modes . The stadium is Sporting Kansas City 's third home venue ; then known as the Kansas City Wizards , the team played in Arrowhead Stadium from 1996 to 2007 and CommunityAmerica Ballpark from 2008 to 2010 . In 2013 , the stadium hosted the MLS All-Star Game , the United States men 's national soccer team , and the MLS Cup , and is the only stadium to host all three in the same year .
History
Initial planning
Originally , Sporting Club , the team 's ownership group , planned to move to southeast Kansas City , Missouri on land previously occupied by Bannister Mall . The redevelopment plan , called The Trails , was passed on December 13 , 2007 . The last package of economic incentives , a $ 30-million tax rebate , was passed on November 21 , 2008 .
The stadium 's planned site had been demolished to prepare the site for infrastructure . It was intended to open in 2011 with a capacity of 18,500 seats . However , fallout from the 2008–2009 financial crisis placed the project on hiatus , and the stadium developer eventually sought to move the new project near the Village West retail center in Kansas City , Kansas , near the Kansas Speedway and CommunityAmerica Ballpark . The developer of The Trails complex sought additional borrowing authority from Kansas City , Missouri , to finance the building of the soccer stadium and its associated amateur soccer complex . However , the city was unwilling to provide the desired financing , leading the developer to seek a new site across the state line .
Construction
In September 2009 , the developer asked Wyandotte County and Kansas state officials for permission to use revenues from existing tax increment financing in the Village West area to help finance the soccer complex . On December 17 , Sporting KC president , Robb Heineman provided an update on the stadium situation published on team official website and blog , basically putting the Kansas City , Kansas location as final , pending the signature of the final agreements . On December 21 , construction machinery was already on the Legends site waiting to break ground on the site . On January 19 , Wyandotte County approved the bonds to help finance the stadium , and on January 20 , the groundbreaking ceremony happened with Sporting 's CEO , Robb Heineman , using heavy machinery to move dirt on the construction site .
Inaugural season
The opening match took place on June 9 , 2011 , as Sporting played the Chicago Fire to a scoreless draw in front of an over-capacity crowd of 19,925 . The first goal would come days later during the 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup when Dwayne De Rosario converted a penalty kick for Canada against Panama . Sporting 's first goal came from C. J. Sapong in a 1–0 win over the San Jose Earthquakes , the club 's first victory in the stadium . Sporting would finish its first regular season in the stadium with a 9–2–6 record at home . Average attendance was 17,810 for the year or 96.4 % of capacity .
2012–present
In the stadium 's second season , Sporting KC averaged an attendance of 19,404 , 105 % of its capacity . That year , Sporting KC made it to the playoffs but lost to the Houston Dynamo in the conference semifinals , and won the US Open Cup by defeating the Seattle Sounders .
In 2013 , Sporting KC once again raised their average attendance . Because of their 2012 US Open Cup win , they qualified for the CONCACAF Champions League , and played games both in the MLS and in CONCACAF . Children 's Mercy Park also hosted to a World Cup qualifying match between the United States and Jamaica with an attendance of 18,467 , where the United States shut out Jamaica 2–0 , and the 2013 MLS All-Star Game between A.S. Roma and the MLS All-Stars with an attendance of 21,175 , where A.S. Roma beat the All-Stars 3–1 . Sporting KC set an attendance record of 21,650 in the playoffs when they defeated the Houston Dynamo 2–1 to advance to the MLS Cup Finals against Real Salt Lake , Sporting won in penalty kicks , the second final in two years to be hosted at Children 's Mercy Park .
Also in 2013 , it was announced that the 2014 through 2018 NCAA Division II Football Championships would be played at Children 's Mercy Park , moving from Braly Municipal Stadium in Florence , Alabama . It was also announced that the 2015 NCAA College Cup would be played at Children 's Mercy Park .
In 2015 , the stadium hosted FC Kansas City 's home opener against fellow NWSL side Sky Blue FC . The stadium also hosted two FC Kansas City matches in 2016 , once again serving as the team 's secondary stadium .
The stadium announced in 2016 that they are adding a Skycam , as well as robo-cams behind the goals and on top of the stadium .
During a CONCACAF Champions League match against Deportivo Toluca F.C . on February 21 , 2019 , a metal railing overlooking the southwest tunnel broke and caused several fans to fall . Toluca winger Felipe Pardo was injured with a toe fracture because of the railing .
International matches

The Pittsburgh and Butler Street Railway , commonly called the Butler Short Line , was a broad gauge interurban streetcar line connecting Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , United States to Butler via Mars .
History
The Pittsburgh and Butler Street Railway was opened in 1907 between Pittsburgh and Butler traveling via Etna , Glenshaw , Allison Park , and Mars . In 1914 the railway converted from AC to 1200V DC which reduced power consumption by 15 % and reduced the weight of each car by 6 tons .
In 1917 the railway amalgamated with the Pittsburgh , Harmony , Butler and New Castle Railway , who operated the Harmony Line between Pittsburgh and New Castle , the new company being named the Pittsburgh , Mars and Butler Railway .
In April 1931 the company went into receivership . The Butler Short Line was closed on April 22 , 1931 as it was in poor condition , services being absorbed into the existing PA 8 bus service . The stub of the Butler Short Line continued to be used by Pittsburgh Railways as the 2 Etna service until closure in 1952 .
Route
Leaving Butler going south along South Chestnut Street the railway crossed the rails of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad ( B & O ) and the Bessemer and Lake Erie Railroad ( B & LE ) , before turning west down the valley of the Connoquenessing Creek through Bredinville . Running parallel to the B & LE through Odell and then east into Thorn Creek past Renfrew Station , the line then headed south , climbing out of Thorn Creek valley alongside Three Degree Road , where the Butler Country Club had a stop of their own . When Butler County Airport was constructed Three Degree Road was diverted to use the old track bed , now forming the eastern perimeter road of the airport .
The line continued south , descending into the valley of Breakneck Creek and passing through Mars . It continued south along the valley , through Downieville and Valencia to Etna , where it joined the local Pittsburgh Railways route to downtown .
Incidents
Two cars collided on March 27 , 1909 after one was delayed by a derailment on the grade crossing of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad near Mars . The crash occurred near Bryant Station and three people died at the scene , all employees of the railway .

Mount Athos has an extensive network of footpaths , many of which date back to the Byzantine period . These paths are typically trails designed for human foot traffic and mules , and are not wide enough for motor vehicles . They connect the various monasteries , sketes , cells , kathismas , and hermitages on the peninsula to each other .
History
Many of the footpaths of Mount Athos date back to the Byzantine period . Some are cobblestone paths ( kalderimi ) , while most are dirt trails ( monopatia ) .
Starting in the 1960s , many of the footpaths began to fall into disrepair . However , in the 21st century , the Friends of Mount Athos and other volunteers have been restoring and maintaining the footpaths for pilgrims and monks to use . Today , most of the footpaths are signed , well maintained , and in good condition . The Friends of Mount Athos footpath group also maps out GPX files for the footpaths and monitors their conditions .

Pretty Baby is a 1950 American comedy film starring Dennis Morgan , Betsy Drake , Zachary Scott and Edmund Gwenn . A young woman 's little white lie leads to unforeseen complications . Cary Grant aggressively promoted Drake , his wife , to Jack L. Warner for the lead in Pretty Baby .
Plot
Patsy Douglas comes up with an ingenious way to get a seat on the crowded New York subway : she pretends to have a baby , using a doll discarded by the advertising agency where she works . One day , however , her agency 's primary client , short-tempered Cyrus Baxter , happens to be seated beside her . ( His chauffeur had abruptly quit after Baxter berated him for getting stuck in a traffic jam . ) He is delighted when he overhears that she named her `` child '' Cyrus after him . He becomes acquainted with her , letting her assume that he works for Baxter as a watchman .
Later , when the agency 's two bosses , Sam Morley and Barry Holmes see Baxter to try to get him to sign a contract for a new advertising campaign , he insists they keep her happy , to their puzzlement . Morley and Holmes discover that she has been fired ; they quickly hire her back and promote her from her secretarial duties .
Meanwhile , Baxter keeps seeing Patsy , trying to help her with his namesake . She manages to maintain her charade , but Morley sees them together and assumes that she is Baxter 's mistress . Patsy discovers her new friend 's identity when her bosses send her to present their latest idea . Meanwhile , Baxter 's temper improves under Patsy 's influence .
When Morley and Holmes finally learn the truth , Patsy wants to confess all to Baxter , but they insist she carry on the masquerade until they get his signature on the contract . She reluctantly agrees , after they point out that they will probably have to close if they do not get Baxter 's business , throwing hundreds out of work .
When Morley shows Baxter a photograph of the baby ( actually a picture of his partner as a child ) , Baxter notices a resemblance to Holmes and assumes he is the father . To placate him , Morley arranges for Holmes to start dating Patsy . In the process , however , he becomes jealous , having fallen in love without realizing it .
When Baxter 's plans for the baby become too overwhelming , Patsy tells him that she will raise her son on her own . She quits the agency as well . Baxter hires private investigator Corcoran to track her down . He finally learns there is no child . Morley confirms what Corcoran has discovered , and also admits he is in love with Patsy . A delighted Baxter insists he go after the girl . Morley catches Patsy on a subway train , and persuades her to get off at the City Hall stop to get married .

The Juniper Island Light on Juniper Island in Vermont is the oldest light station on Lake Champlain and the oldest surviving cast iron lighthouse in the United States .
History
A light station was established on the island in 1826 , displacing a private beacon consisting of a lantern on a post . The tower constructed was of brick , 30 feet tall , and lit with the lamp and reflector system typical of the period . The light was intended to indicate to ship the proximity of Burlington 's harbor . This tower was reported to be in disrepair by 1838 .
A new tower , also tall , was constructed in 1846 . This tower was constructed of four rings of cast iron , attached to a brick keeper 's house through a passageway . This tower originally retained the old light 's beacon , but was upgraded with a fourth-order Fresnel lens in 1853 . Early in the next century , the island was used as a storage depot for fuel , buoys , and other items .
The light was deactivated in 1954 in favor of a steel tower placed closer to the water , and the island as a whole was sold at auction to state senator Fred Fayette . Unfortunately the keeper 's house was severely damaged by fire in 1962 , though the tower and a separate shed for a fog bell were undamaged . Fayette 's family inherited the property , and in 2001 they reconstructed the house using bricks from the remains of its predecessor . Two years later a new , taller tower replaced that of 1954 . The family plans to restore the old tower , but it is unlikely to be relit ( as has been done with other lights on the lake ) since trees on the island obscure it from the water .

, literally `` Mother thrice admirable '' , is a Marian title in Latin given to a miraculous copy of the Salus Populi Romani icon , enshrined at the Münster Zur SchönenUnsere Lieben Frau in Ingolstadt , Bavaria , Germany . The title is a variant of Mater admirabilis ( Mother most admirable ) from the Litany of Loreto .
History
It was first used by the Jesuit Father Jakob Rem , head of the Sodality of Our Lady , in Ingolstadt , Bavaria on April 6 , 1604 . The most common litany used nowadays , the Litany of Loreto , uses the invocation Mater admirabilis , which means `` Mother admirable '' .
On April 6 , 1604 , the Colloquium Marianum of the Jesuit Sodality at Ingolstadt was praying the Litany of the Blessed Virgin Mary . As they came to the prayer , “ Mother most admirable , pray for us ” Father Rem asked for a repeat and again for a repeat of the prayer . Since that time , the Colloquium Marianum and the sodalities used the triple prayer . Mater ter admirablilis continues to be used as a part of the sodality prayers worldwide .
Since 1915 , Mater ter admirablilis is a part of the Marian prayers of the Schönstatt movement . Mater ter admirabilis is also a Marian altar in the Cathedral of Ingolstadt , where the solidarities used to meet on a daily basis for Holy Mass . It was never clarified whether the triple prayer refers to the Holy Trinity , to the triple virginity of the Virgin Mary ( before , during and after birth ) , or , to the Mother of God , mother of the Redeemer and mother of the redeemed .

Tayap ( also spelled Taiap ; called Gapun in earlier literature , after the name of the village in which it is spoken ) is an endangered Papuan language spoken by fewer than 50 people in Gapun village of Marienberg Rural LLG in East Sepik Province , Papua New Guinea ( , located just to the south of the Sepik River mouth near the coast ) . It is being replaced by the national language and lingua franca Tok Pisin .
History
The first European to describe Tayap was , a German missionary-linguist , in 1937 . Höltker spent three hours in the village and collected a word list of 125 words , which he published in 1938 . He wrote that “ it will be awhile before any other researcher ‘ stumbles across ' Gapun , if only because of the small chances of worthwhile academic yields in this tiny village community , and also because of the inconvenient and arduous route leading to this linguistic island ” .
Höltker 's list was all that was known about Tayap in literature until the early 1970s , when the Australian linguist Donald Laycock travelled around the lower Sepik to collect basic vocabulary lists that allowed him to identify and propose classifications of the many languages spoken there . Tayap and its speakers have been extensively studied by linguistic anthropologist Don Kulick since the mid-1980s . The language is described in detail in Tayap Grammar and Dictionary : The Life and Death of a Papuan Language and in A Death in the Rainforest : How a Language and a Way of Life Came to an End in Papua New Guinea .
Until World War II , when Japanese soldiers occupied the area and caused the villagers to flee into the rainforest , Gapun was located on a hill that several thousand years earlier had been an island in the sea that receded and formed the lower Sepik River . This indicates that Tayap may be the descendant of an ancient , autochthonous language that was already in place before the various waves of migration from the inland to the coast began occurring thousands of years ago . Foley ( 2018 ) also speculates that Tayap could have been part of a larger language family that was spoken on the island before the arrival of Lower Sepik speakers . As the coastline moved further northeast , Lower Sepik speakers migrated from the foothills into the new land areas created by the receding waters .
Sociolinguistics
Up to 2018 , Gapun was the only village where Tayap is spoken , although some speakers of the language also lived in neighboring villages such as Wongan and Watam , having moved there because of marriage or as a result of conflicts over land or sorcery in Gapun . However , in 2018 , Gapun village was burned down and abandoned due to violence among households . The former residents fled to the nearby villages of Wongan ( ) , Watam ( ) , and Boroi .
As a result of colonial activity , Gapun villagers subconsciously associate Tok Pisin with Christianity , modernity and masculinity , and they associate Tayap with paganism , `` backwardness '' , disruptive femininity and childish stubbornness . As a result , Tayap is being increasingly , but neither consciously nor deliberately , replaced by Tok Pisin , even though the villagers all express positive sentiments towards it and insist that they want their children to speak the language . Villagers express bewilderment towards the fact that their children no longer actively speak Tayap , and believe that they have , out of stubbornness , decided to reject Tayap entirely , and that they have chosen to speak Tok Pisin instead .
Unlike the neighboring patrilineal Lower Sepik-Ramu speakers , Tayap speakers are matrilineal . Tayap is typologically very different from the neighboring Lower Sepik-Ramu languages .
Tayap also has many loanwords from the Kopar and Adjora languages .
Classification
Tayap is not related to the neighboring Lower Sepik languages , though a relationship to the more distant Torricelli family has been proposed by Usher ( 2020 ) .
In the 1970s Australian linguist Donald Laycock classified Tayap ( which he called `` Gapun '' ) as a sub-phylum of the Sepik-Ramu language phylum , on the basis of Georg Höltker 's 1938 word list and a few verb paradigms that Laycock gathered from two speakers .
Kulick and Terrill ( 2019 ) found no evidence that Tayap is related to the Lower Sepik languages , another branch of the erstwhile Sepik-Ramu phylum . They conclude that Tayap is a language isolate , though they do not compare it to other language families , as would be required to establish Tayap as an independent language family . Comparative vocabulary demonstrates the lexical aberrancy of Tayap as compared to the surrounding Lower Sepik languages : e.g . sene 'two ' ( cf . proto-Lower Sepik * ri-pa- ) , neke 'ear ' ( * kwand- ) , ŋgino 'eye ' ( * tambri ) , tar 'hear ' ( * and- ) , min 'breast ' ( * nɨŋgay ) , nɨŋg 'bone ' ( * sariŋamp ) , malɨt 'tongue ' ( * minɨŋ ) , mayar 'leaf ' ( * nɨmpramp ) among the Holman et al . ( 2008 ) ranking of the Swadesh list . Cultural vocabulary such as 'village ' , 'canoe ' , 'oar ' , and 'lime ' , as well as the basic words awin 'water ' ( cf . * arɨm ) and a 'eat ' ( cf . * am ~ * amb ) , may be shared with Lower Sepik languages . The word karep 'moon ' is shared specifically with Kopar ( karep ) . However , most basic vocabulary items have no apparent cognates in surrounding languages .

Grammar
Like many Sepik languages , Tayap is a synthetic language . Verbs are the most elaborated area of the grammar . They are complex , fusional and massively suppletive , with opaque verbal morphology including unpredictable conjugation class , both in terms of membership and formal marking .
Tayap distinguishes between realis and irrealis stems and suffixes . Verbal suffixes distinguish between Subject/Agent ( S/A ) and Object ( O ) , which is marked by discontinuous morphemes in some conjugations . The ergative case ( A ) is marked by free pronouns and noun phrases , while the absolutive ( S/O ) does not have marked forms . As in many ergative Papuan languages , the ergative marker is not always included , as it is optional .
Nouns
Nouns generally do not mark number themselves , although there is a small class of largely human nouns which mark plural , and a smaller class which mark dual . These categories , where marked , are largely marked by partial or full suppletion . Oblique cases , largely local , are marked by clitics attached to the end of the oblique noun phrase .
Gender
Like many languages of the Sepik-Ramu basin ( particularly the Sepik languages ) , Tayap has masculine and feminine genders .
There are two genders , masculine and feminine , marked not on the noun itself but on deictics , the ergative marker , suppletive verbal stems and verbal affixes . The unmarked , generic form of all nouns , including animate nouns , even humans , is feminine : however , a male referent may be masculine . Another criterion is size and shape : long , thin and large referents tend to be masculine ; short , stocky and small referents tend to be feminine . This type of gender-assignment system is typical of the Sepik region . Gender is only ever marked in the singular , never in the dual or plural .

Fox Crane is a fictional character on the NBC/DirecTV soap opera Passions and was portrayed by Justin Hartley from December 16 , 2002—February 10 , 2006 , and Midland lead singer Mark Cameron Wystrach from February 14 , 2006—September 7 , 2007 . Actor Nick Stabile took over the role temporarily following the 2004 Summer Olympic Games ( which preempted Passions for 2 weeks ) , while Hartley 's wife , fellow Passions star Lindsay Hartley was on maternity leave . Fox , as played by Hartley , was a fan favorite among Passions viewers .
In the show , Fox becomes infatuated with Whitney Russell ; he plots to woo Whitney away from her boyfriend , Chad , but eventually decides to respect her wishes and ends his attempts . He then engages in a brief relationship with his half-brother 's ex-fiancé , Theresa Lopez-Fitzgerald , played by Hartley 's real-life wife , Lindsay Hartley . Though their pairing lasts fewer than six months , Soap Opera Digest readers continued to vote Fox and Theresa their favorite Passions couple until Justin Hartley left the role in 2006 .
After breaking up with Theresa , Fox resumes his pursuit of Whitney , who breaks up with Chad when it is falsely revealed that the two are half-siblings . Their romantic progress is hindered by the fact that Whitney is secretly pregnant with Chad 's child and trying to pass the baby off as Fox 's ; when she uses Fox 's power of attorney to give `` their '' son up for adoption , Fox and Whitney 's relationship essentially comes to an end . Miles 's true paternity is eventually revealed , and Fox moves on with Kay Bennett . Fox is deeply in love with Kay and cares deeply for her toddler daughter , Maria , and Fox and Kay become engaged . However , the return of Maria 's father , Miguel Lopez-Fitzgerald , eventually leads Kay to realize that her heart lies with Miguel and not Fox . In a desperate attempt to keep Kay , Fox enlists his father 's help to fake a terminal illness in order to guilt Kay into marrying him and staying with him . Kay eventually discovers his duplicity , however , and leaves him .
After breaking up with Kay , Fox begins a relationship with his sister 's best friend , Esme Vanderheusen . The two believe that they have found true love when Fox is shot and killed in his bedroom by an unseen sniper on September 17 , 2007 ; the murderer is eventually revealed to be Esme 's fifteen-year-old niece , Viki .
Character history
Early life
Nicholas Foxworth Crane was born sometime between late 1980 and 1982 , the third of six children born to Julian Linus Crane , the eldest child of ruthless billionaire Alistair Ephraim Crane and Katherine Barrett , and Ivy Winthrop , daughter of the late former governor Harrison Winthrop and the late Helen Revere-Mott-Beaton . Fox , as he was eventually nicknamed , was descended from numerous wealthy and prominent families that immigrated to North America before the American Revolutionary War — his paternal grandfather is a descendant of William Ephraim Crane , a magistrate who ordered Tabitha Lenox 's execution in 1693 , thus sparking the witch 's vendetta against the Crane family , and his maternal grandmother was a descendant of Paul Revere . Fox is predominantly of English descent , though he does have some French ancestry , and he was raised in the Roman Catholic Church .
Fox was raised as the third of four children — in 2001 , his older brother , Ethan Crane ( now Winthrop ) , approximately five to eight years his senior , was revealed to be the product of their mother 's adulterous affair with now-police chief Sam Bennett . Fox also has two sisters — Fancy Crane is one to two years his senior , while Pretty Crane is a few years his junior . While they were raised in the lap of luxury , the Crane siblings , excluding Ethan , had a dysfunctional childhood , with Ivy admitting that her youngest three children had a father who was `` either absent or intoxicated '' and a mother `` who just did n't care '' . Ivy favored Ethan over her other children because he was the son of her `` true love '' , Sam Bennett , and not her husband , whom she loathed , and Fox , as well as his sisters , came to resent their mother for this . Unlike his sisters , however , Fox also came to resent Ethan for their mother 's favoritism , and the two men shared an adversarial relationship until the stillbirth of Ethan 's daughter , Sarah Winthrop , in 2003 . Fox also bore a great deal of anger towards his father , also unlike his sisters , and the two did not improve their relationship until 2006 .
Fox , like Fancy and Pretty , was sent away to boarding school at a young age . Fox was popular and excelled at swimming , but he was also a trouble-maker , and Julian and Ivy eventually sent him to Europe to attend school . After graduating from boarding school , Fox went on to attend university , but eventually became bored with his studies and dropped out , taking up gambling to keep himself occupied . Fox quickly gambled his trust fund away , however , and , upon seeing a news report regarding Ethan 's marriage to Gwen Hotchkiss , he decides to finally return to Harmony .
Return home and infatuation with Whitney , 2002 - 2003
Few , if any , members of Fox 's family are happy to have the young man return to Harmony , and they are all even less thrilled when they learn that he has gambled his money away . The only person not irritated by his presence is his new , young step-mother , Theresa , and Fox quickly becomes friends with her , mostly to annoy his family , who despise her . It is through Theresa that Fox meets her best friend , Whitney Russell ; Fox , despite his status as a womanizer , falls for the young woman , unaware that his father and her mother were once lovers . In Los Angeles , Fox teams up with Theresa , whose marriage to Julian is revealed to be a practical joke , and agrees to help her separate Ethan and Gwen if she helps him to win his `` mystery woman '' from her boyfriend . Fox also pays record producer Chad 's new singer , Syd Valentine , to seduce Chad and bring an end to Chad 's relationship with Whitney .
Things grow complicated when Chad 's vengeful wife , LaToya , shoots Whitney for sleeping with Chad . Whitney makes a full recovery , and Fox is thrilled when Whitney leaves Chad for failing to tell her about his previous marriage . Shortly after Fox and Whitney 's return to Harmony , however , they are followed by Chad , and after a heart-to-heart with his father , Fox realizes that , if he truly loves Whitney , he must give her up .
Relationship with Theresa , 2003 - 2004
Whitney eventually comes to believe that Theresa is Fox 's mystery woman , and , instead of correcting her , Fox goes along with her assumption , willing to settle for a relationship with his good friend if he can not be with Whitney . The two eventually become lovers , and Fox supports Theresa when she loses custody of her son to Julian and Rebecca , who then allow Ethan and Gwen to adopt the boy . Fox also continues to aid Theresa in her schemes to see her son and regain custody of him , including drugging Ethan and Gwen 's surrogate and having herself implanted with their embryo .
Fox and Theresa 's relationship eventually ends when Theresa confesses that she has been unfaithful - Fox later learns that she drugged Ethan in an attempt to become pregnant after she believed that she had a miscarriage - and the two part on good terms .
Relationship with Whitney , 2004 - 2005
After breaking up with Theresa , Fox returns to pining after Whitney . Though Whitney shows signs of affection for Fox , she is still engaged to Chad . Their relationship quickly falls apart , however , when Alistair reveals that Chad 's biological parents are Julian and Eve Russell , making Chad the half-brother to both Whitney and Fox . Whitney is horrified to learn that she has slept with her own brother , and she turns to Fox in her despair .
Fox and Whitney eventually become a couple , and Fox is thrilled when Whitney tells him that she is expecting his child . Close to Whitney 's due date , a mentally unstable Gwen kidnaps Ethan and Theresa 's newborn daughter , Jane , and flees the country with her ; when Fox sets off to find his sister-in-law and niece , Whitney convinces him to give her his power of attorney in the event that she needs to conduct any business on his behalf . Fox tracks Gwen and Jane , along with his grandmother , Katherine , to Alistair 's Crane compound in the North Atlantic , where he , Ethan , and Theresa rescue the three females . When Fox returns home , he learns that Whitney gave birth to his son and is thrilled - until he learns that she used his power of attorney to give the boy up for adoption . Fox tries to reverse the adoption , but the time limit has expired and Chad adopts the boy , whom he names Miles Davis Harris . Chad refuses to allow Fox to see his son and largely uses Miles as a way to be close to Whitney .
Whitney 's decision to give Miles up for adoption destroys her relationship with Fox . Eventually , both Chad and Fox learn the truth - Chad actually fathered Miles , and Whitney tried to pass him off as Fox 's son in order to protect him from the stigma of being the product of incest .
Relationship with Kay , 2005 - 2007
While trying to get over Whitney , Fox meets Kay Bennett on the wharf one night . The two bicker , but when a tsunami later hits , the two seek solace together and have sex . Eventually , the two enter into a relationship , and Fox begins to dream of a life with Kay and her young daughter , Maria . After numerous near-misses , Fox finally successfully proposes to Kay , and she happily accepts .
Shortly after they become engaged , Kay 's ex and Maria 's father , Miguel Lopez-Fitzgerald , returns to Harmony . In order to be close to Maria , Miguel moves into Tabitha 's home with Fox and Kay , and when he begins dating Siren , she also moves in . When Kay begins to raise objections to Miguel 's relationship with Siren , Fox begins to fear that Kay 's opposition stems from jealousy . Eventually , Fox overhears Kay and Miguel making plans to call off her engagement and reunite , and Fox , in a desperate attempt to keep Kay , fakes a terminal illness in order to guilt her into staying with him . Fox 's plot works , and he and Kay are married , despite Miguel 's accusations that Fox is not really dying , on January 10 , 2007 .
Despite their nuptials , Kay continues to stand by Miguel 's side when he is falsely charged and convicted of deliberately running Fox down with his car . Julian arranges for Miguel to be released from prison on the condition that Kay end her relationship with Miguel , but Kay is unable to honor her end of the bargain . During a confrontation , Ivy inadvertently reveals that Fox is not really dying , and a furious Kay leaves him for Miguel .
Relationship with Esme and death , 2007
While drowning his sorrows in a bar , Fox comes across his older sister Fancy 's best friend , Esme Vanderheusen . Esme has fallen upon hard times — her father cut her off financially , and she was left the legal guardian of her fifteen-year-old niece , Viki - and Fox generously allows Esme and Viki to live at the Crane mansion as long as necessary . Fox and Esme eventually have sex , and the two declare that they have found their soulmate . Their happiness is cut tragically short , however , when Fox is shot in the chest on September 7 , 2007 and eventually dies on September 17 . Esme is devastated by his death , as are his parents and sisters , and they swear to find the culprit . The audience eventually learns in January 2008 that the sniper , and the murderer of all of Esme 's other boyfriends , is none other than Viki , who feared that Fox would send her away to boarding school if he married Esme .

Louise `` Loulou '' Boulaz ( February 6 , 1908 – June 13 , 1991 ) was a Swiss mountain climber and alpine skier who made numerous first ascents in the Alps .
Biography
Boulaz was born in Avenches , Switzerland . She attended a trade school and worked as a journalist for the International Labour Organization in Geneva .
Boulaz began climbing in the Alps in the 1930s and continued making major ascents until the 1970s . Of her major climbs , four were the first ascents and at least nine were the first female or all-female ascents . At the start of her career , Boulaz and Lulu Durand became the first women to climb the Dent du Requin ( 1932 ) and the southwest face of the Dent du Géant . She made a number of climbs with Durand in 1935 : the first female traverse of the Aiguille des Grands Charmoz ; the first female traverse of Les Droites ; the first female ascent of the north face of the Petit Dru ( with Raymond Lambert ) , and the second ascent ever ; the first female ascent of the Central Spur of the Grandes Jorasses ; the Aiguille Noire de Peuterey ; and the Brenva Face of Mont Blanc . She was the first person to climb the east face of the Bel Oiseau ( 1938 ) , the north face of Mont Vélan ( 1941 ) , and the Rothorn of Valais ( 1941 ) . She was the first woman to climb the Pear Buttress on Mont Blanc 's Brenva Face ( 1939 ) , the Walker Spur of the Grandes Jorasses ( 1952 ) , and the north face of the Cima Grande di Lavaredo ( 1960 ) .
Outside of the Alps , Boulaz traveled often within the Himalaya , the Caucasus and the Sahara . In 1959 , she was a member of the all-female expedition to Cho Oyu where Claude Kogan , Claudine van der Straten-Ponthoz and three Sherpas died during an avalanche . In 1977 , she was the first to climb a new route in the Aïr Mountains of the Sahara , which she named Tour Loulou . She was made an honorary member of the Swiss Alpine Club , even though the club did not allow women to become members at the time , as well as holding honorary membership of the Ladies ' Alpine Club and the Alpine Club .
Boulaz was also a successful alpine skier ; she was a member of the Swiss national ski team in 1936 and 1937 , and in 1937 she placed fourth in the FIS World Ski Championships slalom category in Chamonix .

Robert Bruce Kadramer ( ? - 1963 ) was a Ceylonese politician .
At the 1st parliamentary election , held between 23 August 1947 and 20 September 1947 , Kadramer contested the Batticaloa electorate as an Independent . He received 2,313 votes ( 17 % of the total votes ) but lost to the United National Party candidate , Ahamed Lebbe Sinne Lebbe who polled 4,740 votes ( 35 % of the total vote ) .
In September 1950 the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi ( Federal Party ) established a branch in Batticaloa , with Kadramer elected as the branch president .
He ran again at the 2nd parliamentary election , held between 24 May 1952 and 30 May 1952 , again as an Independent and this time was successful , obtaining 11,420 votes ( 59 % of the total vote ) defeating the sitting member , Lebbe , by 3,460 votes . Kadramer , although a Tamil , publicly questioned the creation of a separate Tamil state arguing that there was no geographic contiguity between the Tamil areas of the east and north .
In 1956 , when the Federal Party competed for the first time in the electorate , Kadramer adopted the party label of the Batticaloa Tamil Speakers Front ( BTSF ) . He was unable to retain his seat at the subsequent 3rd parliamentary election , losing to the Illanki Tamil Arafura Kachi ( Federal Party ) candidate , C. Rajadurai , by 8,004 votes .
Kadramer died in 1963 .

Drug-induced amnesia is amnesia caused by drugs . Amnesia may be therapeutic for medical treatment or for medical procedures , or it may be a side-effect of a drug , such as alcohol , or certain medications for psychiatric disorders , such as benzodiazepines . It is seen also with slow acting parenteral general anaesthetics .
Medical usage
Amnesia is desirable during surgery , so general anaesthesia procedures are designed to induce it for the duration of the operation . Sedatives such as benzodiazepines , which are commonly used for anxiety disorders , can reduce the encoding of new memories , particularly in high doses ( for example , prior to surgery in order for a person not to recall the surgery ) . Amnestic drugs can be used to induce a coma for a child breathing using mechanical ventilation , or to help reduce intracranial pressure after head trauma .
Researchers are currently experimenting with drugs which induce amnesia in order to improve understanding of human memory , and develop better drugs to treat psychiatric disorders and memory related disorders . People with Alzheimer 's disease and other forms of dementia are likely to benefit . By understanding the ways in which amnesia-inducing drugs interact with the brain , researchers hope to better understand the ways in which neurotransmitters aid in the formation of memory . By stimulating rather than depressing these neurotransmitters , memory may improve .
Holmes et al . ( 2010 ) commented that the media misrepresented two recent studies as research on `` erasing '' traumatic memories , but showed the fear response associated with stressful memory could be greatly reduced whilst the factual memory of the trauma remained intact . Similarly , Brunet et al . ( 2008 ) found that the people with chronic posttraumatic stress disorder who were treated with propranolol for a single day had a reduced response to existing trauma while retaining memory of the trauma . In the process of remembering , the memory needs to be restored in the brain . By introducing an amnesia-inducing drug during this process , the memory can be disrupted . While the memory remains intact , the emotional reaction is damped , making the memory less overwhelming . Researchers believe this drug will help patients with post-traumatic stress disorder be able to better process the trauma without reliving the trauma emotionally . This has raised legal and ethical concerns should drugs be found to have altered the memory of traumatic events that occur in victims of crimes ( e.g . murder attempt ) , and whether it is therapeutically desirable to do so .
Non-medical drug-induced amnesia
Amnesia can result from a side-effect of prescription or non-prescription drugs . Both substance use and alcohol can cause both long-term and short-term memory loss , resulting in blackouts .
The most commonly used group of prescription drugs which can produce amnesia are benzodiazepines , especially if combined with alcohol , however , in limited quantities , triazolam ( Halcion ) is not associated with amnesia or memory impairment .
In popular culture
In the 1970 science fiction TV series UFO , amnesia drugs were given to anyone who had contact with SHADO operatives , or witnessed their covert activities .
In Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind ( 2004 ) , Joel Barish ( Jim Carrey ) decides to forget his former lover Clementine Kruczynski ( Kate Winslet ) after she erases her memories of him .
The characters in The Hangover ( 2009 ) deal with the aftermath of amnesia after taking roofies .
An episode of Arrested Development called Forget-Me-Now discusses the use of drug-induced amnesia for those who have seen how magicians ' tricks are performed .
In the PC Game Amnesia : The Dark Descent ( 2010 ) , the player character , Daniel , wakes up with amnesia in the terrifying Castle Brennenburg , and must discover the truth about his memories .
In the book Allegiant ( 2013 ) a `` memory serum '' is used to wipe people 's memories .
The SCP Foundation has referenced amnesia-inducing drugs in many of its articles since its conception , under the name `` amnestics '' , usually as a means of ensuring secrecy from the public .
In the teen fiction novel The Maze Runner , the teen characters wake up in a drug induced amnesia , which is one of the main factors that drive the plot .
In the series 3 episode of Doctor Who , Gridlock , drugs that induce amnesia are sold in patch form with the name `` forget . ''
In the TV series Blindspot , the memory of the main character , Jane , was totally wiped using a drug called ZIP .
In the 2018 Swedish film The Unthinkable , a chemical that induces memory loss , spread via rain , is used as a prelude to an invasion of Sweden .
In mythology
Nepenthe , literally named anti-sorrow , is a substance mentioned in the Odyssey given to Helen of Troy , said to originate from Egypt . Consumption causes sorrowful memories to be forgotten .

Allan Ruggles Purvis ( January 9 , 1929 – August 13 , 2009 ) was a Canadian ice hockey player who played with the Edmonton Mercurys , a team which represented Canada and won a gold medal at the 1950 World Ice Hockey Championships and also won a gold medal at the 1952 Winter Olympics . He later became owner of Waterloo Ford , a local car dealership that had been the sponsor of his medal-winning hockey team .
Purvis was born in Trochu , Alberta . He moved with his family to Calgary and attended Western Canada High School there .
He was invited to join the Edmonton Mercurys when he was 19 years old , having played junior hockey for the Calgary Buffaloes . The Mercurys were sponsored by Waterloo Mercury , a local car dealership whose owner hired some of the team 's players to work for his firm . Purvis , a defenceman , was the team 's assistant captain . Though better known for his checking skills , Purvis was a goal scorer .
The Mercurys won the Western Intermediate League championship and were selected to represent Canada at the 1950 World Ice Hockey Championships held in London , England , where the Mercurys took the gold , winning all seven games they played in the tournament and outscoring their opponents by a margin of 88–5 .
Two years later , the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association selected the Mercurys from among seven teams that had applied to represent Canada at the 1952 Winter Olympics held in Oslo , based on the strength of team 's performance in the 1950 World Championships . Nine countries competed in Ice hockey at the 1952 Winter Olympics , with each team playing each other once . The Canadians played fast , tough hockey and won their first seven games by a margin of 68–11 . The final game for the team was against the United States , who had lost one game to Sweden , meaning that the Canadians would win the gold medal if they did n't lose their last game . After jumping out to a 2–0 lead , the Americans tied the score . Donald Gauf scored to give the Canadians the lead , but the U.S. tied it again at 3–3 with minutes left in the game . A potential game winner for the U.S. ricocheted off the goal post and preserved the gold medal for Canada . Canada would not win another gold medal for another 50 years , when it won at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City .
Following the Olympic victory , Purvis went back to the dealership . He worked his way up the ladder in his 50 years at the firm , becoming sales manager and later the company 's owner and chief executive . After Purvis retired in 2002 , he was succeeded at the dealership by his son .
Purvis died at age 80 on August 13 , 2009 , at his home in the Victoria , British Columbia area due to heart disease . He had met his wife Jeanne while the two were in high school and they had two daughters and a son .

P. V. Manoranjan Rao is a veteran space scientist and author from India . In his career spanning over three decades — including over two decades at the Indian Space Research Organisation 's Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre — he has done extensive research in areas including the physics of lightning discharge , ionospheric physics , magnetospheric physics , VLF and ELF wave propagation , electrostatics of launch vehicles , electrostatic charging of communications satellites , EMI/EMC and lightning protection for launch vehicles . He has edited and authored three books on India 's space history .
Early life
After completing his Bachelor of Science in Physics from Hindu College ( Guntur ) , Andhra Pradesh in 1956 , Manoranjan Rao did his Master of Science in Physics from Banaras Hindu University in 1958 .
Career
During 1959–1961 , Manoranjan Rao did research in theoretical physics at the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science in Kolkata . This was followed by research stints ( 1962–1968 ) on the physics of lightning at the University College of Science and Bose Institute under the eminent physicist Prof. Satish Ranjan Khastgir . In 1968 , he was awarded a Doctor of Philosophy in Physics by the University of Calcutta . In 1969 , he moved to Kuden-kenkyujo , Toyokawa , Japan to continue with his research on atmospheric electricity and lightning physics at the Nagoya University . After spending a year in Japan , Manoranjan Rao joined the National Physical Laboratory of India for a brief stint . Later , at Banaras Hindu University , he worked on whistler phenomenon , which led to his research on very low frequency ( VLF ) and extremely low frequency ( ELF ) propagation in the magnetosphere .
He left Banaras Hindu University in 1973 to join the Space Physics Division ( SPD ) at Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre ( VSSC ) , Thiruvananthapuram .
He has 31 publications in various journals , Indian and international , and has authored 8 technical reports internal to the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre . Over 20 of his articles have been published in newspapers and magazines , and he is quoted often in the media on matters related to the history of the ISRO .
He was the founder-editor of Countdown , the in-house journal of VSSC , and Space India , the in-house journal of the ISRO , from their inception until his retirement . He was also instrumental in reviving the ISRO 's Space Museum in Thiruvananthapuram . He has written the script for over a dozen documentaries highlighting the VSSC 's achievements . At the time of his retirement from theVSSC , he was part of VSSC Management Council , the apex body that works with the centre director in the overall management of the centre .
He retired from ISRO in 1996 as the Group Director of the Programme Planning and Evaluation Group at VSSC .
After his retirement from VSSC , he has worked on the lightning protection systems at STPI Earth Station , Technopark , Trivandrum and the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle launchpad at Satish Dhawan Space Centre . He also continued with his contributions to ISRO 's Space Museum even after retirement — he wrote the content for the museum display panels .
He was the Editor-in-Chief of 50 Years of Space : A Global Perspective , a publication that commemorated 50 years of the Sputnik 1 launch and the 58th International Astronautical Congress ( Hyderabad , 2007 ) . Along with P. Radhakrishnan , a former space scientist , Dr. Rao co-authored A Brief History of Rocketry in ISRO , published in 2012 . This book won the Engineering Sciences Book award for 2014 from the Paris-based International Academy of Astronautics ( IAA ) .
He was the Chief Editor of From Fishing Hamlet To Red Planet , a compendium of articles on the history of the Indian Space Research Organisation and its sequel Ever Upwards : ISRO in Images , both considered to be the authorized and official history of Indian Space Research Organisation .

Praise
“ As an excavator and guardian of our living past , Howard Mansfield is unmatched . This decent , unpretentious , wonderful writer possesses the sensibility of a poet combined with boundless curiosity and deep , deep knowledge . In its quiet , persistent , honest search for timelessness and truth amidst the clamor of our uncertain times , Turn & Jump takes us to the very soul of America. ” –John Heilpern , Vanity Fair
`` Now and then an idea suddenly bursts into flame , as if by spontaneous combustion . One instance is the recent explosion of American books about the idea of place .... But the best of them , the deepest , the widest-ranging , the most provocative and eloquent is Howard Mansfield 's In the Memory House . '' -- Hungry Mind Review
“ Howard Mansfield has never written an uninteresting or dull sentence . All of his books are emotionally and intellectually nourishing . He is something like a cultural psychologist along with being a first-class cultural historian . He is humane , witty , bright-minded , and rigorously intelligent . He and his wife rescued the doomed runt of a litter of pigs and raised it to be the 175-pound Mr. Hogwood , a living symbol of Howard Mansfield 's care for the American , New England , history he writes so well about . His deep subject is Time : how we deal with it and how it deals with us . '' -- Guy Davenport , author of The Death of Picasso
“ Like Thoreau , Mr. Mansfield is a keen observer and , in his neck of New Hampshire , a granitic critic of the rushed life. ” -- The Wall Street Journal
“ The Same Ax , Twice is filled with insight and eloquence… a memorable , readable , brilliant book on an important subject . It is a book filled with quotable wisdom. ” —Robert Campbell , The New York Times Book Review
“ He writes with wit and passion ; he has an eye for the luminous detail , and wears his learning lightly… . In witty essays that recall both Thoreau 's Walden and Roland Barthes ' Mythologies , Mansfield ruminates on American history by unpacking our connection to the landscape. ” — Utne Reader on The Bones of the Earth
Dwelling in Possibility is `` a wholly original meditation ... Mansfield pursues the essence of dwelling and “ the soul of shelter ” in a book-length essay that 's part observation of the contemporary built environment , part cultural history , part philosophical account , and at times something like a Whitmanian poetic survey . '' -- Carlo Rotella , The Boston Globe
“ Hands-down , the finest writer of Yankee life today is this guy , Howard Mansfield . Howard Mansfield sees things differently than most of us , and he points stuff out that most of us miss… Howard Mansfield [ has ] found a way to unlock the Yankee character. ” — Frtiz Wetherbee , Chronicle , WMUR-TV

Inman Valley is a locality in the Australian state of South Australia located on the Fleurieu Peninsula about south of the state capital of Adelaide . The valley is about in area . At the 2016 census , Inman Valley had a population of 343 .
Origin of the name
Inman Valley , and Inman River , was named through association with Inspector Henry Inman , founder and first commander of the South Australia Police , who pursued two allegedly escaped convicts there in August 1838 . No Indigenous name is recorded for the valley itself , but two names are recorded for the river : Moo-oola and Moogoora . The mouth was called Mugurank , meaning 'place of hammerstones ' .
History
The first recorded Europeans to sight the valley were likely the party that accompanied explorer Collet Barker ( but not Barker himself ) in 1831 . In its pristine state the valley abounded in kangaroos , which were hunted for food by early sealers and whalers at Encounter Bay .
Inman Valley was surveyed in late 1839 by a party under Senior Surveyor N. Lipscomb Kentish , formerly of Sydney , assisted by Surveyor Henry Ide , formerly a corporal in the Royal Sappers & Miners ( see Royal Engineers ) . They pegged out the sections and also a line of road suitable for drays leading from Rapid Bay to Encounter Bay , which is now Inman Valley Road .
Immediately following the completion of surveys the land was opened for selection and in early 1840 the first European settlers to establish a homestead at Inman Valley were the three young James brothers : William Rhodes James , John Vidal James and Richard Boucher James . They carved a shortcut—James Track—to their land . In 1858 , together with partners , Richard Boucher James purchased the 60,000-acre Canowie Station , where he lived until 1863 , when he returned to England . In Devon he purchased the Georgian-style mansion Hallsannery House in the parish of Littleham , from where he continued his interest and management of the Canowie Pastoral Company until his death in 1908 .
The other contenders at being first residents of Inman Valley , around the same time , are the brothers Thomas Bewes Strangways and Giles Edward Strangways , but their land was near the mouth of the valley at Encounter Bay . Other pioneering settlers promptly joined them , including William Robinson , the latter being the first to drive a horse and cart over Mount Terrible . Other settlers soon followed , such as John Lush .
Although various crops flourished , and sheep were successful , from the very earliest years cattle were known to thrive at Inman Valley and so they predominated . By the 1880s this led to an extensive dairying industry , including butter and cheese production , with a butter factory being established in 1890 .
Present-day land use is predominantly grazing , dairy farming , forestry and horticulture . The valley area also attracts bushwalkers and tourists .
Selwyn Rock
In the valley is Selwyn Rock ( ) a glaciated pavement in the bed of the Inman River . It was first described in 1859 by , and later named for , A.R.C . Selwyn , who was Victorian Government geologist at the time . Glacial grooves and striations on the polished surface indicate glacial movement to the north-west . Boulder clays , tillites and erratics are also common in the area , which underwent glaciation during the Permian ( approximately 270 Ma ) . The pavement was exposed during the Tertiary when the Inman River eroded the topography to its present-day surface . A cafe overlooks the glaciated bed of the river , with access onto the rock available via stairs and viewing platforms .

The SrnB-SrnC toxin-antitoxin system of the F plasmid is homologous to the hok/sok system of R1 . Like the hok/sok system , it performs a post-segregational killing function , ensuring that all surviving daughter cells inherit the F plasmid . The system consists of srnB ' mRNA , which is relatively stable and codes for the toxic protein SrnB , srnB mRNA , a regulatory element and srnC mRNA , an antitoxin with complementarity to srnB .
Mechanism of regulation and toxicity
The suspected method of regulation has not been directly tested for this system , however due to the strong similarity between this system and the hok/sok system , a mechanism of regulation has been inferred based on the structure of the mRNA and the mechanism used to regulate hok expression . The gene system consists of a stretch coding for srnB ' , srnB and srnC mRNA . srnB completely overlaps srnB ' and is partly overlapped by srnC . It appears that translation of srnB ' is dependent on translation of srnB , so regulation of expression of the SrnB toxin can be achieved indirectly by regulating translation of srnB . It is thought that the initial mRNA transcript of srnB ' is translationally inactive , and in plasmid-containing cells it will slowly bind srnC mRNA and be cleaved , or it will be specifically cleaved on the 3 ' end and rapidly bind srnC , which indirectly inhibits translation of srnB ' by regulating translation of srnB and causing cleavage . In a plasmid free cell , srnC degrades rapidly and remaining srnB ' mRNA is processed into translationally active 3'-truncated mRNA which yields the SrnB toxic protein , killing the cell . The mechanism by which SrnB causes toxicity is not known , however similarity between the SrnB toxin sequence and the hok toxin sequence suggests that they make have similar functions .

Fine Clothes to the Jew is a 1927 poetry collection by Langston Hughes published by Alfred A. Knopf . Because it departed from sentimental depictions of African-American culture , the collection was widely criticized , especially in the Black press , when it was published. < ref name= '' rummel '' > Rummel , Jack ; Wagner , Heather Lehr ( 2005 ) Langston Hughes : Poet , p. 52 . Infobase Publishing , < /ref >
Publication and response
The title appears in the poem `` Hard Luck '' in the book 's first section . It refers to a phrase popular in Harlem at the time , referring to citizens who would pawn fine clothes to predominantly Jewish-owned pawn shops when they were short on money .
The collection was Hughes ' least successful in terms of both sales and critical reception . However , his first work The Weary Blues '' and this collection made his reputation . Biographer Arnold Rampersad called it Hughes ' `` most brilliant book of poems . ''

A marine evacuation system ( MES ) is a lifesaving device found on many modern passenger ships consisting of an inflatable slide or escape chute where a passenger can evacuate straight into waiting life rafts . Developed in 1979 by RFD , a New Zealand-based company that distributes safety equipment ; MES is replacing traditional davit-launched life rafts used on ships .
MESs are common on high speed craft , where weight and evacuation times must be kept to a minimum , although many conventional ferries and cruise ships are now fitting MESs to complement or replace lifeboats .
The main manufacturers of MES are Survitec Group ( RFD Beaufort and Brude Safety ) Zodiac , Viking , and Liferaft Systems Australia . They take very little space on deck , positioned on the front of the embarkation deck and on the sides of the ship . MES requires little time and effort to assemble , which is crucial in times of emergency .
Evacuation
MES has gained popularity over the past 30 years due to its mass evacuation ability . It is one of the only life saving appliance ( LSA ) that can evacuate over 700 people in 30 minutes . It is a well-tested technology gaining vast popularity in the industry due to its ship safety enhancing capabilities in emergency situations . It has been tested in Beaufort Sea State 6 winds and 3 , wave heights and the slide prototype has been tested in accordance with EU Directive of Marine Equipment 96/98/EC and IMO Resolution A689 ( 17 ) as amended .
MES requires only one or two staff members to deploy . The chute automatically falls into the water where a life raft starts to inflate ; the whole process takes approximately 90 seconds , with some systems claiming to fully inflate within 1 minute . Once the lifeboat has been inflated , people are asked to jump down through the air-cushioned chutes into the rafts , which can hold more than 700 people .
Components
The MES consists of 5 components .
Controls- used to initiate the device in an emergency situation .
Stowage box- contains essentials for the evacuation , including the chute and the fixed appliances , such as seats , rails , etc . Composed of marine grade aluminum along with inflation cylinders , usually kept on the deck taking as little as 4 m2 of storage space . It is considered to be lightweight , weighing around 685 kg including the life rafts stored inside .
Chute or Slide- attached to the ship and life rafts , it is stored in the stowage box . Inflatable slides are composed of polyurethane coated nylon fabrics making it sturdy . It ranges up to 13.6 m in height , including single and double evacuation slides depending on the vessels preference .
Rafts- are the floatable boats used in an emergency event . Depending on the MES system , there are usually 1-4 rafts in the stowage box .
Bowsing winch- in an electric system that is used to transport the raft from the ship to the side of the ship .
Types of MES
Chute and Dual Chute Systems – commonly used on large cruise ships , they take little space , and provide fast evacuation for large numbers of people .
Mini Chute Systems – used by smaller vessels that have a low embarkation deck . It is light in weight and compact , therefore easily stored in the stowage box , and can be assembled anywhere on the vessel .
Slide Systems – is an inflatable slide that attaches to the access point of the evacuation , similar to the ones on aircraft .
Mini Slide Systems – used by ferries and yachts that have a low embarkation deck
Direct boarding life rafts – used for vessels with low deck heights because it floats parallel to the vessel , requiring people to directly jump onto the raft . It is ideal for mass evacuations .

The Shreveport Mudbugs are a Tier II junior ice hockey team based in Shreveport , Louisiana , as a member of the North American Hockey League . The new Mudbugs replaced a former professional team that played in the area from 1997 to 2011 known as the Bossier-Shreveport Mudbugs .
History
From 1997 to 2000 , Shreveport , Louisiana was home to a professional hockey team in the Western Professional Hockey League ( WPHL ) named the Shreveport Mudbugs . In 2000 , the Mudbugs relocated to nearby Bossier City to play out of CenturyTel Center and changed their name to the Bossier-Shreveport Mudbugs . The Mudbugs then joined the Central Hockey League in 2001 when the WPHL merged with the CHL . The professional Mudbugs would eventually fold in 2011 citing low attendance and financial issues even though the team had just won the league championship .
In October 2015 , it was announced that a new Mudbugs team would return for the 2016–17 season after signing a 12-year lease agreement with the Louisiana State Fairgrounds and returning to Hirsch Coliseum but as a member of the Tier II junior North American Hockey League . On April 8 , 2016 , the Shreveport Mudbugs were officially announced as an expansion team in the NAHL . Former Bossier-Shreveport Mudbugs player , Karlis Zirnis , was named the team 's first head coach .
In their second season , the Mudbugs finished first in the South Division at the end of the regular season and played their way through the Robertson Cup playoffs to take the NAHL championship in 2018 . Following the season , head coach Zirnis left the team to take an assistant coaching position with the University of Alaska-Fairbanks hockey team .

MV Okanagan was a tugboat that operated on Okanagan Lake , Penticton , British Columbia , from 1947 to 1972 . It was the largest and last Canadian Pacific-operated tugboat on Okanagan Lake and its retirement marked the end of Canadian Pacific 's service on B.C . 's inland lakes and rivers , as well as 80 years of service on Okanagan Lake . During service , the Okanagan pushed railway barges up and down the lake and broke ice during winter .
Construction
MV Okanagan was built in 1946 by West Coast Ltd. Shipbuilders . It was all welded steel with a diesel engine , and had 800 horsepower . The vessel was designed and built at Vancouver , then broken into pieces and shipped to the Okanagan Landing shipyard to be reassembled . It was 110 ft. long , 24 ft. wide , 12 ft. 6 in . deep , and had a draft of 10 ft . The Okanagan had an eight-cylinder diesel engine and electric pumps . The engine had two Vivian backups , which were generators that were used to prestart the engine , preheat oil , provide electricity , and fill the air compressor tanks . Everything except for the hull , engine , and motors was made in British Columbia .
The boat had accommodation for 14 people . Eight crewmates slept below decks in double berth cabins , while the cook had a private room by the galley on the main deck . Four private rooms for officers were on the engineer 's deck and the captain 's office and private bedroom was behind the pilothouse .
Crew
Two notable skippers of MV Okanagan were Captain Walter Spiller and Captain Sam Podmoroff . Spiller was born in 1898 and worked for Canadian Pacific for 46 years . He was a relief skipper for many ships , including SS Sicamous and captained the Okanagan for many years . He worked all the major routes during his career and obtained a Master 's degree in 1930 before his retirement in 1963 .
Podmoroff worked with Canadian Pacific for 31 years and was the Okanagan 's last skipper . He began his career as a deckhand on the SS Valhalla and later the SS Moyie , two ships on Kootenay Lake . He came to the Okanagan as first mate on the tug Kelowna 1947 . He became captain of the Okanagan and he docked the ship for the last time in 1972 , marking the end of Canadian Pacific 's service on Okanagan Lake .
Service
Boat traffic in the Okanagan saw a steep decline in the 1960s . The Okanagan was the regular service vessel during this time and comfortably handled the traffic between Penticton and Kelowna . The Okanagan 's main function was to push railway barges filled with fruit and other cargo to the rail station to be shipped away . It could push two loaded barges of 700 tons each at 11 miles per hour . The boat was also used to break ice with its steel hull , replacing the tug Kelowna . The tugboat SS Naramata became a relief tug for the Okanagan , especially during harvest season and when the Okanagan was refitted in the summer of 1967 . The Naramata became mainly a seasonal vessel , while the Okanagan operated year-round .
Retirement
MV Okanagan 's last trip was May 31 , 1971 , under Captain Podmoroff .
It was moored at Fintry , British Columbia until 1981 . That year it was bought by Vic LeBouthiller . Mr LeBouthiller and crew carried out extensive renovations on the ship and gained permission from Kelowna city council to dock it near the downtown marina . The ship was used for charter parties services over the next four years , serving locals and tourists who reported endless hours of summer fun on the lake under Captain Fog 's ( Vic LeBouthiller 's ) command . In 1983 the ship was used in an attempt to break the world water ski record of 70 skiers . They achieved the feat of 37 skiers being pulled by the MV Okanagan during a practice run . Certain he would break the world record during the Okanagan regatta event , with the TV Show That 's Incredible filming , Mr. LeBouthiller fell shy of the record after over-loading passengers on the ship in anticipation of the wild post world record on-board party . One of Captain Fog 's primary values was `` we 're here for a good time , not a long time '' . The ship had over 200 guests and spectators on board and did not achieve sufficient speed to tow the 74 water-skiers in its wake . Over time the ship was used as a floating restaurant called Mad Jac 's and was eventually sold . It is now moored in the North Okanagan , where it remains today .

Back Door Men is the second album by The Shadows of Knight . Both this album and its predecessor , Gloria , were released in 1966 and are considered to be seminal garage band albums . As noted by one reviewer , `` The original LP version of this album , the second by the legendary white Chicago garage punk/blues outfit , was one of the most sought-after artifacts of mid-'60s punk rock . Back Door Men was a loud , feedback-laden , sneering piece of rock & roll defiance , mixing raunchy anthems to teenage lust ( Gospel Zone ' , 'Bad Little Woman ' ) , covers of Chicago blues classics ( Willie Dixon 's 'Spoonful ' , Jimmy Reed 's 'Peepin ' and Hidin ' ) , raga rock ( 'The Behemoth ' ) , folk-rock ( 'Hey Joe ' , 'Three for Love ' , ' I 'll Make You Sorry ' ) , and a blues-punk grab off of commercial Top 40 ( 'Tomorrow 's Gon na Be Another Day ' ) , all on one 12 '' platter . What makes the record even more startling is that every one of these tracks , however far afield they go from one another , works . `` .
Background
Back Door Men was recorded at Universal Recording in Chicago , Illinois , in late 1966 . The album was recorded as a quick follow-up to the Shadows of Night # 10 debut release Gloria . By the time of this recording , Warren Rogers and Joe Kelley had traded instruments and David Wolinski had been added on keyboards . `` Bad Little Woman '' , a cover of the Belfast band The Wheels , backed by `` Gospel Zone '' was released as the first single , but only charted as high as # 91 . A second single , `` I 'm Gon na Make You Mine '' , a non-album cut backed by `` I 'll Make You Sorry '' did only slightly better at # 90 . A third single at that time , `` Willie Jean '' ( a Hoyt Axton tune incorrectly identified on the label as `` traditional '' ) / '' The Behemoth '' did not chart . As with their first album , production was credited as `` Produced for Dunwich Records '' instead of crediting a specific producer . The original album incorrectly lists Dino Valenti as the composer for `` Hey Joe '' .
